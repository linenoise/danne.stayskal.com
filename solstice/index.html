    <p>At sunset each Midwinter, we gather on the cold, windy shores of Puget Sound to catch the fading light of the sun in an array of simple oil lanterns. Once we have the sun's light safely distributed to each of us, we carry it together across Seattle through the longest night of the year. We stop for food, warmth, and good company along the way. The next morning, we release the light along with our prayers to the shores of Lake Washington, encouraging the sun to hasten its return.</p>
    
    <p>This is an eighteen-mile, all-night, all-weather urban hike on the longest night of the year.</p>

    <p><strong>When and where is this?</strong></p>
      
    <p>The hike begins at 4:20 PM on Friday, December 21st, 2018 in Golden Gardens Park. It ends at 7:55 AM on Saturday, December 22nd, 2018 in Seward Park.</p>

    </p>
    
    <p>In Golden Gardens Park at sunset, we hold our lanterns to the horizon and catch the dying rays of light. From there, we hike in silence until we get to the Ballard Locks. There, we say introductions, state intentions, and share warmth and company. We'll make it to Alina's home in Fremont by dinner. She always feeds and cares for us well.</p>
    
    <p>From Alina's, we head south to Lake Union Park and check in with each other. Then, it's on to the Space needle to play on the playground, then turn and head to Capitol Hill to rest for a moment in Cal Anderson Park. Once we're ready to keep moving, we hike to Danne's home to refuel.</p>

    <p>From Danne's home, we head south through Jefferson Park to Chris's home, where we have breakfast, writing our prayers down for the coming morning. We head out in earnest from there to meet the shores of Lake Washington at Seward Park. There, we write prayers on paper boats, releasing them and the rays of our lanterns to the sunrise. At the conclusion of the hike, anyone who joined us along the way is welcome to head to Brice's home to relax.</p>

    <p>A full route and timetable is presented further on down this page.</p>

    <p><strong>Who does this?</strong></p>

    <p>This event is led every year by Danne Stayskal, Brice Reinhardt, and Julia Trimarco. If you know one of them, you're probably welcome to attend—just email to confirm. If you received a link to this page in an email directly from one of them inviting you to this event this year, that means we would love for you to attend.</p>

      </p>
      
    <p>The group usually numbers around 25 to 35 people at different parts of the hike. This event is you, us, and our intentional family. It's one of the ways we stay close through the long, dark Seattle winters.</p>
    
    <p>When you're invited, you're free to invite as well, within two boundaries:
      <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>Please invite only the people to whom you'd give a key to your own home. That's the bar we hold each other to for this event.</li>
        <li>Please don't link to or post about this event on social media. Our hosts have limited capacity—enough for our closest people.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Can I bring kids and pets?</strong></p>

    <p>You are welcome to bring children, so long as you can keep them warm and tended-to. This is a family-friendly event.</p>
    
    <p>Our hosts aren't able to accommodate pets, so you'll need to make other arrangements for your four-legged family members.</p>
