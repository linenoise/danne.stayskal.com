      Howdy,

      I carried a little black book everywhere at Burning Man again this year, recording noteworthy happenings. Here are the contents of that book. Anyone who wants a copy of last year's burnlog, email me and I'll send it your way.
   
      Photos and walk-through videos of our art installation, The Silk Road, are live on my portfolio site: http://danne.stayskal.com/artwork/silk_road/
   
      Let’s keep reply-alls to a minimum, etc. Really glad to be back safely in Seattle.
   
   Love you,
   —Danne
   
   BUILD WEEK
   ==========
   
   Tuesday, 8/19
   -------------
   Midnight: Up all night packing and finishing code for work.
   10:00am: Trailer hitch install
   Noon: Pick up the trailer in West Seattle
   1:00pm: Got home, passed out on keyboard
   5:00pm: Woke up, inhaled some food, back to packing.
   7:00pm: Tried to unhook trailer, wouldn't budge, drove to Eastlake with a big, empty, noisy trailer behind me.
   7:45pm: Headed to Trader Joe's in the University District to buy playa food. Got creative parking a Jetta and a trailer to do so.
   11pm: Gifted with a book of photographs of each of my closest people from Clamoring. Cried a little.
   
   Wednesday, 8/20
   ---------------
   12:30am: Up all night packing and finishing code for work.
   4:00am: Finish building solar array. Bloodied a finger in the process. Twice. Same finger.
   7:00am: Finish laundry, packing food, and staging things to load in the trailer.
   9:00am: Hanging out with Shane to compare playa schedules. Later joined by Ken.
   10:00am: Passed out for a few hours.
   2:00pm: Headed to pick up David and his bins.
   2:30pm: Get David's bins loaded, said goodbye to Melley, creatively maneuvered car and trailer backwards, uphill, out of a skinny apartment parking lot.
   3:00pm: Picked up Kent and his things, headed back home to load my gear.
   5:00pm: All gear tetrised into the trailer, heading to Black Rock City, driving and sleeping in shifts with David Betz-Zall and Kent Bozlinski. Excellent conversation on the way down.
   
   Thursday, 8/21
   --------------
   H:00am: Start mildly hallucinating while crossing California border. Hand the keys to David.
   8:30am: Arrive at Will Call. Can't drop off EA passes for other art project folks. Kent coordinates logistics, David and I rest.
   10:00am: Got to the gate. Greeter named "G" (Gary) groped my breast without asking. David rang the bell and made a dust angel. Welcome home!
   10:30am: Got to BRC science center. No sign of Keith, Papa Bear, or placers. Nothing here but a bunch of empty sand and some stoners from Montana. Head to The Artery to meet up with art project crew.
   11:00am: Arrive at The Artery. No sign of Kent or anyone else from Silk Road having shown up. David and I crack the windows and sleep in the car.
   3:00pm: Woken up by a bundled-up stranger letting himself into my car who I soon discover to be Jonwa! Yay! He tells me David is in the shade at the Artery, and we're going to meet up at Center Camp at 5pm to head to where the Silk Road will be setup.
   3:30pm: David and I arrive back at BRCSC. Nate from Rack'em'up tells me and David where Keith wants Moonrock. We "set up" camp (put up tents and quickly toss in our possessions) and head straight back to Center Camp.
   5:00pm: Make two rounds at Center Camp, can't find anyone from the art project. Head out to inner playa to drive around and try and find our art project truck.
   6:00pm: David and I find our art placement and help with truck unload. We're right on the road between The Man and The Temple, just a few hundred feet from the temple. Wow. Headed back to camp.
   6:30pm: Back at camp, we setup David's tent. I put together a quick pasta and soysage dinner for us. We relax for a bit.
   9:00pm: Unpacking and setting up my tent.
   11:00pm: Done setting things up, ran into Jason, who invites us out for drinks at Tokyo ranger station.
   11:30pm: Heading to Yes! And? camp to hang out with Jason, Erin, and David.
   
   Friday, 8/22
   ------------
   midnight: Cuddle pile with David and Jason!
   1:00am: Greeted by porta-potty placers who want us to move Erin and Jason's whole camp somewhere else to make room for more restrooms near Distrikt. Conflict mediated skillfully by Erin.
   3:00am: Cuddle pile joined by Erin and moved into Jason and Erin's tent.
   4:00am: Head out to roll through town with David, Jason, and Erin.
   4:30am: Jason and Erin decide they're done for the night. David and I return to camp.
   5:30am: David asks consent to cuddle, which I enthusiastically offer. We head to his tent and engage excellent conversations about life goals and trajectories.
   7:00am: Fall asleep with David.
   9:00am: Feeling very sick (dehydration, probably), I head to my tent to sleep. David heads to Silk Road art project to help setup. Can't keep food down, can't take medication for the day.
   3:00pm: Woke up, ate some Kung Pao that stayed down. 
   3:30pm: Took AM medications very late. Starting to feel MS symptoms return (limping, left arm muscle constriction).
   4:00pm: Headed back to Silk Road to show people how to do the electronics installations. 
   5:30pm: Completed testing of all lighting kits. Only issue was on some EL wire for Yazd.
   6:30pm: Yazd lighting kit repair complete. Hooray for soldering delicate electronics in 90 degree heat and 20 MPH dust-wind!
   7:30pm: Art project break for the day.
   8:00pm: Back at camp, exhausted, hungry and sunburned, Keith tells David we need to move, that Nate told us the wrong spot. David, Bacon, and two of our new neighbors help us move my tent, belongings, and shade structure. My stuff is now in total chaos, and one of my water containers spilled all over my bedding.
   9:00pm: Fell asleep on the ground, hungry and cold, on the verge of emotional breakdown.
   11:00pm: Severe depression (people consistently missing pronouns today). Held hands with David until it passed.
   
   Saturday, 8/23
   --------------
   Midnight: Cooked dinner. Fettucini Alfredo. Stayed down just fine.
   12:30am: Returned to setting up tent again.
   1:30am: Haven't got everything together, but still very tired and cold. Blankets still very wet from the tent move. Dressed warmly and sleep on the ground.
   8:00am: Woke up to alarm clock.
   9:00am: Breakfast (pop tarts), cleaning, getting ready to head back to Silk Road for electrical installation.
   10:00am: Back at Silk Road. Instruct the rest of the team on how to install my lighting kits, and we all get to work on that. Limp becoming far more painful and pronounced.
   11:30am: Note that it's very surreal to be in my Volkswagen Jetta, parked by the road between The Man and The Temple, facing the man.
   Noon: Silk Road breaks for the afternoon (it's very hot out).
   12:30pm: Back at New Moonrock camp. Lunch (Mac and cheese, Kung Pao). Setup shade structure and bed, which is now dry. Said hello to Grace, who is our across-the-street neighbor at ESD!
   1:00pm: Pass out in tent, on the cot this time.
   3:00pm: Woke up, said hello to Jack and Jesse, packed tools I'll need in order to build us a power grid (bolt cutters, multimeter, screw terminals, etc), headed back to art project.
   4:00pm: First bike ride on playa. Okay, this is finally starting to feel like Burning Man rather than just crazy survivalist desert car camping.
   7:00pm: Silk Road power grid build complete! All terminals showing 126VAC when connected to the generator. 
   8:00pm: Break for the day and head to an art car housing the Feed All The Artists camp. 
   9:00pm: Dinner in a circle on the ground with David, Bacon, Kent, Julia, Jonwa. Discussion of favorite Star Trek characters and episodes:
      * Me: Data, Darmok. Obviously (the linguist part of me wins out on this question).
      * Bacon: Worf, Trials and Tribblations.
      * Kent: Data, The Measure of a Man (this is a close runner-up for me).
      * David: Lt. Barkley, Star Trek 6 (the movie)
   10:00pm: Back at camp, greeted Becky and Chunter. Finished integration of solar array so we can test it tomorrow.
   11:00pm: Sleep. Like a rock.
   
   BURN WEEK
   ==========
   
   Sunday 8/24
   -----------
   2:00am: Fell asleep (est.) Lots of art cars out tonight.
   6:30am: Woke up to alarm, promptly fell back asleep.
   7:30am: Woken by David. Get ready to head back to project for final electronics integrations.
   8:00am: Back at art project, first arch (#3, Chang'an) goes up. 
   9:00am: First light! Connected Chang'an to test power.
   11:00am: Most of the arches are now standing. Nearly in tears.
   Noon: Samarkand is up!
   4:30pm: All arches are now on the production power grid.
   5:00pm: All arches are up and have lighting kits integrated (except for Samarkand, which only just got its facades and still needs EL wire installed). Head back to camp for a brief break.
   5:30pm: Dinner (spinach and tomato linguini), then nap. Solar array appears to be working, so I run a power drop into my tent to keep the lights on, charge radios, etc.
   6:30pm: Headed back to art project with slapdash work light partss in my backpack. Run into Jess Pikul at the 9:30 and C porta-potties.
   7:00pm: Soldered together some quick work lights out of spare parts I had in my tent (LED floods, speaker wire, and a spare AC plug).
   8:00am: Brought power grid online. Patched a ground plane break at #3/Chang'an.
   8:11pm: First light of all arches. Cried. 
   9:00pm: Everyone else headed out for the day. David and I stay to finish Samarkand EL wire installation.
   9:30pm: Generator runs out of fuel. Can't get in touch with anyone from the project over radios. Art Support stops by and gives us glowsticks to staple to the arches and generator.
   10:00pm: Back at camp, cleaned up, had some carrots and hummus. Greeted Gorski at his shade hut.
   
   Monday, 8/25
   ------------
   Midnight: Relaxing and listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox. Turns out that if you leave Hydrogen alone long enough, it will eventually invent Dubstep.
   1:45am: Finally finished getting home setup. Notice that a neighboring camp appears to have an unencrypted access point. Follow up with email from Jenn Dolan about her arrival timing.
   2:45am: Fall asleep to a Bluegrass cover of Led Zeppelin playing next to the flaming octopus art car.
   9:00am: Woken up by a series of thunderstorms that are setting off car alarms all around me. Wondering how the art project is doing. Fall back asleep.
   10:00am: Woken up again by thunder. Ovehear this is the most rain a Burning Man has seen since the 90s, and that lightning hit the BMIR radio station. Feeling pretty certain that at least one part will have shorted on the build. Everything around me is mud.
   1:00pm: Woke up fully rested for the first time in weeks. Lunch of Satay. Start getting ready for the day. Mud drying back into playa sand.
   2:00pm: David leaves with my bike to get more ice from Center Camp.
   3:00pm: Start writing TED talk on the Synaesthesia simulator guitar.
   4:00pm: David returns with ice and my bike. Apparently the line at Center Camp Arctica is very long. The other two are closed due to rain and not having been built yet.
   4:!5pm: Sig Pikul is here and said hello! Chat with David, Sig, Gorski, and Jess at my tent.
   5:!5pm: Inbox zero. From my tent. Going back to writing the talk.
   6:00pm: Headed back out to get daytime photos and video of the silk road art project and make any necessary repairs.
   6:15pm: Met up with art project crew, decided last steps that need to happen to call it "done." AMAZED that nothing shorted out during the thunderstorm.
   6:45pm: Back at tent, inhaled dinner (spinach fusili), soldered together some last nights for signs, headed back to Silk Road.
   7:00pm: Finished lighting for Samarkand, soldered two more floodlights into LIVE AC WIRES (very carefully). Toured multiple visitors through the arches. Received three Black Rock City Subway tokens as a thank-you from one kind visitor.
   9:00pm: The Playa has completely destroyed my butane-powered soldering iron. It lasted only three days. It was a good soldering iron.
   10:00pm: We officially call The Silk Road "done". Hugs and tears all around, we return to our respective camps.
   11:00pm: Back at camp, greeting Andrea and Shane, who have just finished waiting 17 hours in the gate line. 90% packet loss from my tent. I suspect we might be at Burning Man. Further suspect this access point is back-ended by TCP over carrier pigeon.
   12:00pm: Off to wander with David!
   
   Tuesday, 8/26
   -------------
   12:30am: Met Keith and Andrea, then headed out to check out art.
   1:30am: Trash fence.
   2:30am: Seeing the library of Babel installation, built to mimic the piece of literature by Borges. Astonishingly beautiful.
   3:00am: On the way back from The Man to camp, we find a woman shivering and incoherent, dramatically underdressed for the fifty degree night (tights, a light jacket, a t-shirt, a ziploc bag, and a small half-empty container of water). David gives her his hat and I my jacket, and we begin slowly walking her back to her camp.
   3:15am: Her difficulty walking is getting more pronounced. I flag down a passerby to go summon a medic. She clearly needs medical attention.
   3:30am: Medics arrive and see to her health, transporting her back to 9:00 ESD. David and I return to his tent to warm up.
   4:30am: Uploading Silk Road photos and video to Facebook.
   5:30am: SLEEP. Shivering. Bundled in a heavy jacket, flannel, two t-shirts, two pair of pants and two pair of socks.
   11:45am: Woken up by the heat.
   12:30pm: Getting up for the day. Poptart breakfast again.
   1:00pm: Greeted by Paul Fenwick, Schwern, and Erin!
   1:30pm: Greeted Sean Thayer at Moonrock! 
   1:45pm: Playa gifts packaged, David and I head to center camp to find the Silk Road processional.
   2:00pm: We circle center camp a few times, head to the installation and back twice, and find only Devon. We do the blessing with me, David, Devon, and Aaron. Photographic evidence taken that included me, so I decide to go public with the name / pronoun / presentation change a week early (from my tent) so people aren't surprised by tagged photos showing up here and there.
   3:10pm: Headed to Cleu Camp with David and Aaron.
   3:30pm: Arrive at Cleu Camp. David and Aaron receive their Cleu brainwashings and pendants. David and I head back to Moonrock.
   4:15pm: Back at camp, meet up with Jason and say hello to Jesse. Jason heads to Yes! And? to find Erin to form an adventuring party.
   5:00pm: Adventure beginning with David, Erin, and Jason.
   5:30pm: Checking out inner playa art--bike ramps and other great ways to break a collarbone.
   5:45pm: Greetings and hangings-out with Leslie and Indigo at HOOcamp. We four head back to Yes? And! via Moonrock.
   7:00pm: Back at Yes? And! we run into Jason's sister Marisa. Haven't seen her in years, not since 2012 PLZKTHX(GVNG). Waiting for Erin to get tacos together (some manner of camp responsibility, I understand).
   7:45: Decide to head back to Moonrock and wait for Erin there.
   8:30pm: Still waiting for Erin to wrap up camp responsibilities. Jason, David and I head out to deep playa to check out art. 
   8:38pm: Pass by fuel depot, mistaking it for an art installation.
   8:45pm: Unlit overhead flight.
   9:00pm: Checking out the Silk Road. Looks like someone's broken Rome's side lights.
   9:15pm: Jason climbs the minaret. David and I stay behind in safety and warmth.
   9:45pm: We stumble upon an art installation that turns the ground to ice, then lava, and reacts with rainbows to our every move. Incredible build.
   9:55pm: See some manner of magical device that converts beautiful classical music into a faucet of sweeping colors. This and the Library of Babel are probably my favorite pieces this year that I didn't myself help bring out there.
   10:00pm: Back at moonrock, still waiting for Erin.
   11:00pm: Find Erin in Jack's tent. Head there to spend time with them. Meet Christi, Erin and Jason's friend from camp.
   
   Wednesday, 8/27
   ---------------
   12:15pm: Erin and Jason leave to spend time together. David, Christi and I head back out to see more art.
   12:30pm: David and I give Christi a guided tour of Silk Road, which she helped fund.
   1:00am: We're back at Yes? And! to wait for Jason and Erin. Sitting next to a generator, watching the stars. Very lonely. Missing companionship.
   1:10am: David and Christi want to head to a wine bar at 7:00 and E. I'm out of social energy. We part ways and I head back to camp. 
   2:00am: Laying down on the ground in my tent, trying to stay together. Still very much shivering.
   3:30am: Still shivering while trying to sleep, despite wearing seven layers of shirts, hoodies, flannels, and jackets. Decide I might not have enough calories to stay warm. Eat some cold Phad Thai, peanuts, olives, and a Clif bar. Shivering abates within 15 minutes.
   4:00am: Sleep.
   11:00am: Woken by someone building something in camp. Change batteries in tent fans, breakfast (pop tarts and coffee), cleaning up, inbox zeroing. Today is going to be a Getting Shit Done From My Tent day. I'm taking the day off of Burning Man.
   1:00pm: getting to the business of default-world transition (DNS updates, letter to parents, social media account updates, codebase changes and redirects, etc).
   5:00pm: JENN DOLAN HAS ARRIVED. Temporarily taking the day off from taking the day off to help her unload her stuff.
   8:30pm: Have successfully heated and eaten another dinner that probably won't hurt me. Fusili something or other. Still unable to properly clean burn scars from my only pot. Make a note to bring something other than a flimsy plastic spoon to cook with next year. Also, more than one dish rag.
   9:30pm: Silk Road walk-through video uploading very slowly to Vimeo. Trying to write an email to parents about name and pronoun change. Not getting very far. In tears. Don't want to lose them again (I felt like I did last time I transitioned, in 2007).
   10:15pm: Interrupted by odd genetics question by a fellow named Chirp from the post office. Momentary physical contact from Gorski, which was very sorely needed.
   10:30pm: Headed to trash fence to continue writing.
   
   Thursday, 8/28
   --------------
   12:00am: Heading back to camp. Decided to let my parents' reactions just be my parents' reactions. Letting go of that now.
   1:00am: Sent parents an email telling them about the transition in as firm and gentle language as I can author.
   1:20am: Lights go out in my tent.
   1:30am: Ran into Jenn Dolan as I checked on my solar array inverter. Sat and talked with her, which was really wonderful.
   1:45am: Joined by Jack! Yay :)
   2:00am: All tired; calling it a night.
   10:30am: Woken up by Monica telling me I have a package. Received care package! Delivered by Chirp again, successfully dodge being dragged back into a thoroughly untestable discussion of his theories of genetics. Then quickly headed to use the restroom.
   11:00am: Getting ready for the day. Breakfast (pop tarts, yet again) and tidying up the tent. Was wearing a skirt, but changed back to jeans once I tried to ride my bike in it.
   11:30am: Fixed solar array--I think. The panels for some reason just came unplugged (wind?), and the deep-cycle battery went totally dry.
   12:30pm: Headed out with David to drop off Playa gifts.
   12:45pm: Dropped off Erin and Jason's playa gift at Yes! And?
   1:30pm: Finally found DPW, greeted Xeno and Eri, dropped off Eri's gift as they were on their way to a parade.
   1:45pm: Stopped by Jerk Church cathedral looking for a bag David left there the previous night. No luck.
   2:00pm: Dropped off playa gifts with Funyun and Bruce. Received a loaf of bread that was delicious!
   2:15pm: Relaxing at Conduit under their misting tent. Maria shared some cold melon. No Kent to be found. Heading back home.
   2:45pm: Back at Moonrock, lunch and staying cool. David headed to tea at Silk Road. White-out dust storm on the 9:00 arterial on the way home, asthma acting up. Inhaler working well. Also, lights are back on in my tent--looks like the solar array fix worked! 
   3:30pm: Shane stopped in to say hello. Sat and talked about technology and relationships for an  hour. Tentatively invited to adventure with him, Andrea, Chris, Becky, Chris, and Jess later tonight.
   4:30pm: Shane goes back to his tent. Lay down for a nap.
   6:00pm: Woke up, getting taco together.
   6:30pm: Hanging out in Shane and Andrea's tent.
   7:30pm: Snacky dinner (carrots and hummus, mostly).
   7:35pm: Heard back from mom about the name and pronoun email. All is well. Happy tears. Updating gender, name, pronouns, and photo on sites.
   8:35pm: Heading out to adventure the playa with Shane, Andrea, Chunter, Becky, Gorski, Pikul, Jack, and Kayleen.
   9:00pm: Fire tornado + fireworks at an art burn
   11:00pm: Deep playa bathroom break. Andrea starting to feel ill, it seems.
   
   Friday, 8/29
   ------------
   12:00am: Head back out to roll around town with Shane and Andrea.
   12:30am: Run into Jenn and Jesse at Silk Road. Journey with them and Shane and Andrea for a bit.
   1:00am: Temple. Left photo of grandma (who died a few months after the burn last year) as well as Kayobi in a wheelchair.
   2:00am: Lose track of Jesse and Jenn (oddly, right after discussing the difficulties of finding people in deep playa) as Andrea, Shane and I head out to another art piece. 
   2:30am: Hot chocolate next to a shifty-glowing double-helix pillar, a raver cuddle pile in the nighttime dust.
   3:00am: Back at camp to recharge. Andrea and Shane head off on a pair-bonding wander. I email about name and pronoun change motivations (a good time to hit the empathy button) to the relatives who seem to be having a hard time with it. TL;DR: No recorded experiences of suicidal ideation when presenting as female over the past decade. When presenting as male, this appears in my data at least once a month. Meticulous record-keeping FTW!
   3:30am: Finished with emails, go out to chill with Jack, Gorski, Grace, and Kayleen at the Moonrock shade structure.
   4:00am: Shane heads to sleep, Andrea and I hang out talking in my tent for a few hours talking about the EFF and online community-building (which she’s done as well!).
   6:15am: Tried to wake Shane, no luck, Andrea and I head to the Embrace burn.
   7:15am: Andrea and I run into Jenn and Jesse at Embrace among crowds of thousands of people, oddly enough the very instant Andrea said Jenn's name in reference to some backpack lights. They didn't notice us until we tapped their shoulders and said hello. Their reactions: "No fucking way" and "Oh my God", respectively.
   7:35am: Embrace burns wild glowing double-helix pillars of bright, hot flame that greets the sunrise with praise.
   8:00am: Andrea and I head home. I pass out in my tent, greeting Monica en route.
   3:00pm: Woken by wind. Updating burn log, eating, tidying, getting ready to host whoever comes by at 6.
   6:00pm: Paul Fenwick stops by to say hello; we plan an adventure during Burn night tomorrow at 6pm to include David. I go back to processing name changes across websites. My goodness, I'm on too many sites.
   9:00pm: David and I leave to see Mt. Infinity burn. Get there, learn it's delayed, I return to make dinner.
   10:35pm: Dinner (mushroom ravioli and soysage), and managed to construct a cup of something not entirely unlike actual coffee. Woot.
   
   Saturday, 8/30
   --------------
   2:20am: DONE with everything I need to take care of transition-wise that's not blocking on me telling my coworkers (GitHub and LinkedIn, mainly). Inbox zero, etc.
   4:00am: Slept.
   10:30am: Woken up by David bringing ice! Yay! Promptly fell back asleep.
   1:30pm: Woken up again. Getting ready for the day. Breakfast of pop tarts, again. 
   2:45pm: Trying to get all the playa dust off hands and feet so I don't get chemical burns by the time I get home. :) Notice two small chemical burns, one on each foot. Treat with brine from a pickle.
   3:30pm: Reading (Goedel, Escher, Bach, ch. 8-10) to catch up with the Tautology Club reading group.
   5:30pm: Bike adjustments. Seat is finally at a height that doesn't hurt my knees. And the rear brakes finally work reliably now.
   6:00pm: Heading out to adventure with Paul Fenwick & David
   7:00pm: Arrived at man burn perimeter with Paul and David during a 1.5-hour white-out dust storm. Cuddles and vegemite.
   9:00pm: Conclave fire show! We're at 9:30ish.
   9:30pm: The Man Burns.
   10:45pm: Man FINALLY falls over, after which all of Black Rock City attempts to go to the porta-potties at the same time.
   11:30pm: Back at Moonrock with Paul and David to refill on water and head back to see more art. Finally recognize Celeste Thayer (I have a very hard time with face recognition when makeup is involved) and say hello.
   
   EXODUS WEEK
   ===========
   
   Sunday, 8/31
   ------------
   12:45am: At the Library of Babel, overhear a concert cellist playing Bach's cello sonata #3 (one of my all-time favorite classical pieces) followed by two other gorgeous pieces I couldn't place. Absolutely amazing.
   1:20am: Back at Moonrock to pick up a hoodie and play some Beethoven on my synaesthesia simulator guitar for Jack, Kayleen, Sig, David, and Paul. Paul says my music looks like fairies. I take this as a compliment. 
   2:00am: Heading out to rave with David and Paul.
   2:30am: Hear the Electric Dandelion show at Apex, 10:00 and C.
   3:00am: Spontaneous fire show up very close at 9:00 and Esplanade by same folks who were the 9:30 conclave. Thanked them personally for their talent and show.
   4:00am: Hanging out at the electric tree pagoda, listening to very loud, drunken stories from an Scotsman. Who keeps putting nickels in that guy? David sings Folsom Prison Blues for Paul. I can't wait to spend the winter with my lovers. Feeling missing companionship needs hard today.
   5:00am: At the heavy-metal drive-through burn pile where someone spontaneously, unexpectedly burns their sombrero.
   5:15am: Headed to Freestyle Palace to pick up warmer things for Paul. It's getting cold out. I'm dressed as a true Cascadian: Sigur Ros hoodie under a flannel over three t-shirts. And soviet ushenka hat.
   6:00am: Watching the sunrise with Paul and David at the Classical Music marshmallow color fountain. Spontaneous ballet breaks out by some clearly VERY talented dancers.
   6:30am: Sun is visible, Paul stays during the Hallelujah Chorus. David and I head back to camp.
   7:00am: Unpacking, refilling, eating, etc.
   8:00am: Brief nap.
   11:00am: Wake up, prepare for the day.
   11:30am: David and I head back to Silk Road art project for teardown.
   noon: Silk Road teardown starts
   2:00pm: All arches are down, and the electronics are stripped. Recoverable wood all loaded into a truck to become a house.
   3:00pm: Laying down in the shade of a minaret, flat on the desert floor next to an art car playing really loud reggae. Backpack = pillow.
   4:00pm: Potluck shows up with lunch, vegetarian chili, at the same time as the flatbed taking the OSB facades to the burn pyre.
   4:30pm: Silk Road Art Project MOOP sweep complete. The art piece has been converted back to a pile of tired hippies and dirt. We pack the last of the scrap wood into the build truck to take it to the 6:00 burn pile.
   5:00pm: The drive / bike ride to the burn pile feels like a funeral procession. We get there, toss in the last of the wood, then I head back to camp. We plan on meeting at Potluck (6:15&G) at 8pm to make the Temple burn together.
   5:30pm: Hanging out with Jack, David, Sig, Jess, Jenn, Pikul, and Kayleen drinking in the Moonrock shade struture. Finally, the shade structure is filled with a small enough group of people I mostly know that I can spend time there without anxieties! Yay!
   6:00pm: Napping.
   7:30pm: Woke up to head to Potluck. Found David, get ready to head out.
   7:45pm: Turn and notice the TEMPLE IS ALREADY BURNING. Way ahead of the announced schedule, AGAIN this year.
   8:00pm: Walking towards the already burning temple with Jack, David, Kayleen, Sig, and Pikul.
   8:15pm: Arrive at temple. Said goodbye to grandma / parent figure (I love you, I miss you, I'm sorry, and I forgive you). Hugs to everyone. A native american man in full regalia burns white sage and winds himself through the silent crowd.
   9:00pm: Walk back to camp alone. Overwhelmed by sadness. Pass the flower galaxies on my way back to camp. Pause and think fondly of Lauren. I'm fully lit, and am almost hit by an art car.
   9:30pm: Packing up shade structure and tent contents.
   11:30pm: Everything staged for trailer load. Heading to Jerk Church Cathedral to say goodbye to Jack, Kayleen, Jenn, and Jesse
   
   Monday, 9/1
   -----------
   Midnight: Most of the city is dark, deserted, and cold, most of the street signs are missing. Hecklers on megaphones giving me shit for being lost.
   12:30am: Finally find the cathedral. Jack and Kayleen have left for the evening. Said goodbye to Jesse and Jenn, wait for David to say a final couple of goodbyes among lots of loud, jovial, very drunk burners.
   1:00am: David, Bacon, and I head back to Moonrock camp to pack up the trailer.
   1:25am: Arrive back at camp, brief emotional breakdown in tent.
   3:08am: Everything is packed into the trailer, MOOP sweeps complete, we head to gate.
   3:10am: See Grace at ESD on the way out of town. Give her goodbye love and hugs while David heads to Tokyo ranger station to report the loud and angry domestic dispute going on the next camp down from Moonrock.
   3:57am: Exodus from BRC complete; back on Nevada state roads. Wow, that was fast.
   9:30pm: Arrived in Sacramento, CA at Aunt Sherri and Craig's house. First time meeting her, one of the three rainbow sheep of the family. The three of us head out to get brunch with her while Craig stays home to study.
   11:00pm: Brunch at Fox and Goose, then head by Safeway on the way back to Sherri's.
   1:00pm: SHOWER. OH. MY. GOD. SHOWER. Also, treating minor chemical burns on my feet. Also, clean clothes. Starting to feel marginally human again.
   4:00pm: Departed Sacramento northbound to Seattle.
   
   Tuesday, 9/2 
   ------------
   Midnight: Crossed the California border into Oregon, listening to all of Led Zeppelin's self-titled albums in order, followed by Pink Floyd, DSOTM.
   8:30am: Droped off Bacon at her apartment. Goodbye hugs.
   9:30am: Unloaded all of my gear at my house in a pile in my bedroom. Greywater and solar array unceremoniously dropped in the back yard for disassembly.
   10:30am: Dropped off David at his apartment, this time creatively parked half on the sidewalk.
   11:00am: Power-wash trailer, car, and bikes at the coin wash on 23rd and Union.
   11:30am: Dropped trailer back off at UHaul in West Seattle. So glad to have my sports car back, unencumbered by towing load.
   12:30pm: Dropped off David's bike, greeted Melley with two- and three-party hugs.
   1:00pm: Back at home, unpacking, cleaning, sorting, centering, and putting things away.
   6:00pm: Final update to burn log for 2014. Everything is in its right place for the winter.
