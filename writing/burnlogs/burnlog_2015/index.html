      Howdy,

      Every year I've been to the burn, I've carried a black notebook in my pocket, recording everything I do out there. Once I'm back home, I type this all up and send a copy to anyone I mentioned in my notes as well as anyone who asks for a copy. This year is no exception! My burnlogs for this and the other two years I've been are attached to this email. 
   
      TL;DRs:
   
      2013: First year, survived, barely knew folks but made meaningful connections with a few other Moonrockers. "Numbers Machine" went from being the name of my home in Portland to being the name of my tent in BRC as I orchestrated my move from Portland to Seattle later in the year. Lots of temple business. Lots of time at the trash fence. Underfed, oversocialized and overstimulated, I burned out well before the end and decided not to return. Fun at times, but not my party.
   
      2014: Second year, decided to go since Silk Road needed an engineer (power, lights, and structural) and gave me a ticket. Plus, this cute fella [0] invited me. Overwhelmed by too many commitments: launching a tech startup from the playa (not taking time off of work to burn), transitioning genders [1], building a major art installation, and writing my second TED talk (presented 11 days after exodus) all added up to me again deciding not to return. Silk Road was awesome, though! Tamsin: I fixed the factual error you pointed out here a few months ago about the photo book.
   
      2015: Third year. Yeah, so, there's this bridge. Trevor gets his idea funded. I agree to build an art support camp from this math/science art collective we've been putting together for Critical, Toorcamp and other regionals, and to do the light and power engineering for the bridge. We gather a tribe, arrive a week early, survey the village, build a camp, build a bridge, burn a bridge, and all return home safely. I successfully juggle commitments, nutrition (kind of), companionship, and downtime, and have the first burn I actually really liked! 
   
      Burning Man was better next year.

   2015 BURNLOG
   =============
   
   Build week
   ==========
   
   Monday 8/24
   -----------
   7:00am: Up all night packing, still. Was up all night last night drill-pressing and angle-grinding conduit for the shade structure. Or maybe that was the night before. Third all nighter in a row, punctuated by moments of restless sleep. Starting burnlog for the year in that little black notebook I carry around everywhere with me.
   9:00am: Finish packing everything but clothes. All village, camp, and art project stuff is packed, labelled, and ready to go. Starting to throw some clothes in a bag.
   10:45am: Lucretia arrives, packing truck to leave for BRC.
   11:30am: Jump into the shower for one last time before we leave for the desert.
   2:30pm: Truck fully loaded! Car stereo improvised in the glovebox out of a JBL Pulse speaker, an iPod, and a mess of cables. I pass out in the back seat.
   5:00pm: I take my first shift as glovebox DJ.
   7:45pm: The smoke billowing off of the catalytic converter gives us pause. Moving the fire extinguisher next to the front seat.
   8:30pm: Picking up final things at the Walgreens in Portland.
   10:00pm: Dinner at Bye and Bye in Portland on Alberta.
   
   Tuesday 8/25
   ------------
   Midnight: Checking in at the La Quinta in Eugene, Oregon. Downloading firmwares, software updates, maps, routes, and timetables we'll need for the rest of the journey. Marking up paper maps as backups.
   2:30am: Inbox zero. Vehicle pass transferred to Joe. I pass out next to David.
   7:30am: Woken by David to get ready to leave again.
   8:00am: Breakfast: biscuits and gravy. Complementary breakfast isn't that bad here.
   8:30am: On the road, heading to Klamath Falls from Eugene.
   11:30am: Engine overheating, billowing smoke again. We pull over every hour or so to let things cool off.
   4:00pm: Pulling over again, this time for around an hour to cool off the engine and let the smoke dissipate. Poor Jeep.
   4:30pm: Wrong turn into Nevada, start to backtrack. That road isn't actually a road any longer.
   5:30pm: Back on the correct road to Gerlach.
   6:00pm: Alex starts marking up little pink survey flags to plant around the village for us and the other camps:
      * Shady Asylum: 28 flags
      * Yayflags: 24 flags
      * Cupcake Brigade: 14 flags
      * AO: 16 flags
      * Rack'em up: 12 flags
      * Moonrock: 8 flags
      * Potluck: 16 flags
      * Tautology: 16 flags
      * Science Center Road: 16 flags
      * Dirtrave Road: 22 flags
      * Ravers & Strife: 17 flags
   7:00pm: Through the gate, rogue our own greeter shift. Alex makes a dust angel! Welcome home!
   8:00pm: Found BRCSC placement and a pile of all of our gear scattered between our plot of dirt and our back-door neighbors' plot. Gear is surrounded by a pile of very tired-looking hippies, otherwise the whole block is just a horizon at this point. Start moving things to our side of the imaginary line. 
   9:00pm: Meet the back-door neighbors camp lead, Stephan with Cirque Gitane. Negotiating our border so they can have part of the fire lane that they requested. Our village's camp leads weren't aware of any border agreement about fire lanes. Providing them passage to their septic areas routing a fire lane through R&S next door.
   10:00pm: Me, Alexandra, David, and Caroline start surveying the village in the dark using radios, flashing lights, hand gestures, flags, a measuring wheel, hope, love, and caffeine.
   
   Wednesday 8/26
   --------------
   Midnight: Handing off surveying to Alex and David so Lucretia and I can start sorting out the shade structure.
   2am: Arranging parts of the structure where they go now that Tautology borders are a known quantity. David and Alexandra retire for the evening. Lucretia and I stay up to make sure shade is up by sunrise.
   4am: Lucretia and I take a break from screwing the structure together to go check out inner playa. The city is still mostly an empty horizon at this point, though the man and temple are clearly visible from our front door. We're here before THE WORD this year. It's in progress, but still just says "DREA_". Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος.
   5:15am: Bungee-balling shadecloth. Still.
   6:30am: Adam and Holly with Shady Asylum arrive and setup camp next door to us.
   7:30am: David and Alexandra wake up and return to helping with the shade structure.
   8:00am: Shade structure is up, David and Alexandra go back to surveying.
   8:18am: Village survey complete (AO and Rack'em up lines straightened out).
   9:00am: Everyone who's here at Tautology is now setting up their tents. I'm no exception here. Dano! and Ashley help move things from our trailer into my tent and kindly set things up for me before I even noticed!
   11:30am: I pass out in my tent.
   4:45pm: Woke up again, starting to get oriented and acclimatized. Repeating slowly to myself, "this is normal."
   6:00pm: Dinner with Lucretia, Alexandra, and Trede. Pickles, tasty bites, salmon, and whiskey.
   8:00pm: Lucretia, Trede, Alexandra and I head back to the BRC gate to pick up guidebooks and maps so we can navigate the city.
   9:00pm: Back at gate, still nobody is here. We rummage around and eventually find where they keep the What Where When guides and maps, grabbing a few for us. 
   9:07: Arriving people mistake us for actual greeters, so we play the part, pulling a rogue greeter shift to welcome wayfaring travelers into the city. I'm gifted with a bunch of hugs and swag. Eleven virgins make dust angels.
   10:00pm: Stop by Mazu to check in on their progress and see if they need help. Can't find Jane to confirm burn perimeter plans for Lucretia next Friday.
   10:30pm: Stop by Temple to check in on their progress and see if they need help. Everything looks on schedule and is already breathtakingly beautiful.
   11:00pm: Impromptu all-hands meeting at Inflection to get oriented on what the next steps are during build.
   11:30pm: Back at camp, setting up the solar array and antenna mast. Drunk women, power tools, and high voltage: welcome to Black Rock City.
   
   Thursday 8/27
   -------------
   2:30am: Solar is online, auxiliary (PWM) charge controller isn't turning on--the one that worked in Seattle just one week prior. Routing all panels through the primary (MPPT) controller (which thankfully it is rated for, at capacity of 800W).
   6:06am: The zipper breaks on my tent. Front door no longer closes. This will be the Numbers Machine's final voyage on the dusty sea.
   6:30am: Woke up to sunlight through the broken front door of my tent. Notice and hug Shane from Potluck! 
   7:00am: Unpacking and setting things up in my tent, grazing for breakfast, helping folks find where things go. Decide to pin the village and camp maps to my front door so I'm no longer a single point of failure for spacing and placement.
   8:30am: Finally remember to give Mars and AJ's Tautology pendants to Caroline for handoff after the burn.
   9:00am: Greet SK, Junni, and Audra from AO!
   10:00am: Antenna mast up, though solar array isn't working. Voltages aren't steady, and it's not charging the battery. Suspect one of my inverters is busted. Switch to backup battery and secondary inverter, then head to Inflection.
   11:00am: Starting lighting build at Inflection, getting the mast lights mounted.
   Noon: First soldering on playa this year!
   11:30am: Met up with Grace at Inflection! Spoke with her about my father's heart surgery and what the survival odds are. Breathe a little easier, despite that I can't get online yet. Gestures of mutual affections exchanged!
   1:00pm: Wheels and Meals stop by to feed the Inflectioncrew. I get invited to talk about light art on BMIR! Given a green bracelet as access to the radio station that's too small and cuts off the circulation in my right hand. I pocket the green rubber bracelet and inhaling some microwaved food offered freely by strangers.
   2:00pm: Final soldering of ground lights. First of three stages of lights are online.
   4:00pm: Project takes a break from building art to go watch DPW launch a flaming piano from a trebuchet for someone's birthday.
   4:20pm: At 4:20 and Esplanade. Although the party is large and raucous, there is no piano in or near the trebuchet. We relax briefly on top of Web of Dreams' bus, then head back to Inflection as DPW drunkenly drops an anvil a couple of times from their construction gear. I am photographed by a stranger (with consent).
   5:00pm: Installing ground lighting on masts with David. This is mostly me holding the ladder and David doing the actual installation.
   7:00pm: Heading back to camp for another TastyBites dinner. Run into Mike, Patty, Giles, Ritchie, and Dana from Potluck and Jack from Moonrock! Solar array beeping incessantly. I turn it off and get back to debugging it.
   8:00pm: Batteries still not charging. Verifying voltages and switching to the other backup solar deep-cycle sealed lead acid battery. Good thing I brought four of those.
   9:00pm: Passed out in my tent.
   
   Friday 8/28
   -----------
   6:00am: Woken by sunrise again. Really need to get those shadecloth sides up on the new Tautology Prime shade structure.
   7:00am: Breakfast. Pop Tarts and scotch.
   7:30am: Caught up with Galvin on the way back from the portos!
   8:30am: Catching up with Patty and Andrea!
   8:45am: Cleaning up tent, removing as much dust as I can, andchanging into fewer clothes. It's going to be really hot today, no need for a long skirt.
   Noon: Solar is online on the auxiliary inverter. Verified voltages again with full sunlight exposure. It's working during the day.
   1:00pm: Checking in at Inflection. Side lights are my next project there, which will require a bit more untangling and soldering. Thankfully Ken taught Alexandra how to solder, so she's basically handled that for me. Best Cousin Ever.
   2:00pm: Heading back to camp to pick up my other playa laptop so I can recode the microcontroller to the correct side lighting lengths.
   2:30pm: High voltage stuff at Inflection all online. Power grid is live! We learn that white-out dust storms on their way.
   6:00pm: Back at camp, ratchet-strapping everything down and inhaling a quick dinner. Meet Lauren Brand / Little Wing from Cirque Gitane, our back-door neighbors! We exchange contact information, party invitations, and synchronize calendars.
   7:30pm: Back at Inflection, keeping Kendra company through an injury. Talking through some of the next round of light-work with Alexandra. Head back to camp to pick up more ratchet straps.
   8:30pm: First OMG moment on playa: As I bike back towards Inflection after sunset, I see my lights right next to the man. Those lights were under my bed just a few days ago. This city and its art just got much more personal.
   9:00pm: Brainstorming winter skillshare sessions and tracks. This is an incredible group of people that I'd like to help keep close through the winter and spring. Decide to send that out a few weeks after Exodus.
   10:00pm: Hoisting the bridge with the combined help of Tautology and Potluck.
   11:00pm: Brief nap in the 24-foot project trailer due to mild upper back pain. Decide to forego additional hoisting of large wooden objects.
   11:30pm: Back to work, getting ice for Lucretia and Alina.
   
   Saturday 8/29
   -------------
   Midnight: Spontaneous conclave performance at the bridge! 
   12:30am: Pass out in my tent.
   7:30am: Woken up by another white-out storm, covered in dust and gasping. Moved to Caroline's tent (at her concerned invitation) to continue sleeping.
   8:13am: Woken up again by radio. It's Andrea Waite!
   8:45am: Getting ready to head to Inflection to help pick up Lifecube's spare wood for us to use as kindling during our burn.
   9:00am: At Inflection, loading all project stuff on the truck.
   9:15am: At Lifecube, loading their scrap wood onto the truck.
   9:30am: "It's such an honor to be burning with you, Linenoise."
   10:00am: Meet Ryan with Tree of Impermanence (here, ironically, for it's second year of installation). Talk about solar with him. Learn from him that there's a camp here that will help you fix a broken alternative energy system!
   11:00am: Off to Alternative Energy Zone (aka "fix your broken solar array camp") to get some pointers on where my solar setup might be broken.
   11:20am: Stopped by Mazu again looking for Paul Gafni (to give him his Tautology pendant). Lindsay says she hasn't seen him today.
   11:40am: At Playa Surfers camp, Angel offers some of his spare atomizers. Deeply grateful.
   Noon: At Alternative Energy Zone, describing the problems I'm running into with my solar array. They're befuddled as well. I decide to change out the charging cables and re-serialize the panels. Testing everything individually.
   1pm: Back at Tautology, soldered new leads on the main battery, re-serialized panels. Solar array demanded blood sacrifice to get the MC4 connectors moved around. Affix band-aids and electrical tape on that finger. Array now cooking with half as much power (400W) but hopefully functional. Time will tell if the batteries actually charge this time.
   2:00pm: Back at Inflection with new deadlines from art support. We've got to be done and gone very soon. We strike camp there, and MOOP sweep Mattress and Trevors' tent sites.
   2:30pm: Dustpocalypse 2015 begins. Me and Lucretia fluffing the team who's building the bridge in 20MPH winds and white-out dust.
   3:15pm: We get the message from art support to evacuate our work site. Winds expected to be 30-50MPH over the coming few hours. They ask us to drive (really) through the whiteout with a spotter out front and get to safety in our camps.
   4:00pm: Riding in the back of a dark 24-foot trailer through the whiteout, slowly back to Tautology. I estimate that our shade structure will survive 30MPH winds and /should/ survive up to 50 before becoming a dusty series of projectiles. Inflection (minus web of dreams) is all hanging out at Tautology now, drinking, waiting out the storm.
   6:30pm: Potluck invites Tautology over for drinks. We accept and stumble over there.
   7:00pm: Setting up the pallet rack at Tautology, seeing as how the project truck is here anyhow. Potluck joins in the barn raising.
   8:45pm: I discover my true artistic talent next to the portos: self-flagellating poi-spinning. Really good at thwacking myself in the face with these little glowing orbs. 
   9:20pm: Back at Inflection, Andrea Waite shows up to help! Haven't seen her in seven years, since that wedding in Delaware.
   10:30pm: Lighting conductivity and polarity tests complete. 33A power supply tested and connected. We start coding up the microcontrollers for the side lights, the second of three lighting builds.
   
   Burn Week
   =========
   
   Sunday 8/30
   -----------
   Midnight: First light of side lights! Not impressed with the refresh rate on the existing demo code, but everything is and will be illuminated. Trede is now here helping Andrea Waite and I with lights and controllers.
   1am: Hand Andrea Waite my laptop, asking that she do what she can to improve the refresh rate of the existing demonstration code. Show her where my library paths are, and start stack tracing with her for a moment.
   1:10am: Close to burnout, I take a mental health walk with Lucretia.
   2am: By the time I'm back from walking with Lucretia, Andrea has our refresh rate fixed, by far exceeding my expectations. Floored again.
   2:30am: Need a reset, taking a 20 minute nap in the back of the project trailer.
   3:00am: Cold starting to set in, I run back to camp to pick up as many blankets as I can carry. I ratchet-strap six of them to my bike basket and head back.
   4:00am: Wrapping all tested side lights around a trash can. A DISCO TRASH CAN.
   4:30am: Trailer Nap 2.1.pre-alpha
   5:45am: Wake up in the trailer, moop sweep the build site, starting to hang side lights on the bridge.
   7:00am: Return to camp to get meds for the day. Andrea heads back to camp to get a change of clothes.
   9:00am: Andrea returns to help finish lights, Mattress heads to work.
   9:35am: Visit from Art Support asking our fuel needs, and telling us to move our truck to camp by 6pm. I record and relay the messages.
   10:00am: I take lead at the build site so Trevor can get some sleep.
   11:30am: Ryan from Tree of Impermanence offers me a ride back to Tautology to pick up two solar panels we're not going to use this week and a couple of MC4 splitters. The ride? A motorized long-board towing a reclining lawn chair. Dig it. Disconnect panels, and after a brief repair of an exploded torque converter en route, he has me back at Inflection by noon.
   Noon: Burning Man 2015 opens right as we finish our last rope splice on the bridge!
   12:30pm: Electrical re-route complete. Side lights should now have power. And the light garden is installed!
   1:00pm: Back at camp, solving parking issues next door to keep the fire lane open.
   1:15pm: Passed out in my tent.
   6:45pm: Woke up cold and hungry, project truck should be here by now (according to Art Support's expectations). It isn't. Really need my cold weather and  personal lighting gear that's on there by sunset. Starting to shiver in a bad way.
   7:30pm: Rushing to head to Academy of Arts and Sciences by sunset. Can't find their address or any of my maps. Broke down in tears in my tent. Hugs from Dano!.
   8:00pm: Heading all over BRC (Inflection, Academy, Arctica, Tautology) by bike with Lucretia, looking for the project truck. Can't find it anywhere. Wrap up in borrowed blankets and wait.
   9:30pm: Project truck finally shows up at Tautology. I quickly extract my things and the last of the bridge lights, biking to Inflection as fast as I can.
   10:00pm: A line has formed at Inflection, with people starting to climb all over the bridge as I'm soldering the last of the lights and affixing them to the bridge with Third's help. Greet Brice, Kyle, Galvin, Giles, Jenn, and Jesse.
   10:08pm: Final lights in place. Inflection is complete.
   10:15pm: Back in camp to decompress and eat.
   11:00pm: Dinner with David, Alexandra, Elf, Zobeewa, Dano!, Trede
   
   Monday 8/31
   -----------
   Midnight: Going to Burning Man with David
   1:00am: Met Vince at Bioluminati, trying to find Jonwa to give him his Tautology pendant. The Jonwa sleeps.
   1:15am: First time walking across inflection. David holds my hand through the twist.
   1:30am: Meeting Dockie and Austin, two family members of Kendra. 
   1:45am: Meet Becky (NYC) and Carolyn (Cincinnati) at Inflection. Decide to form an adventuring party with them.
   2:00am: Visiting The Man with David, Becky, and Carolyn. Trying to figure out how they made those amazing LED displays at The Man base this year. That's a very high-density pixel array.
   3:00am: Talking with Carolyn about customs and import regulations at a bar near center camp.
   4:00am: Stumble upon a church with a pipe organ. Sit down and play some Beethoven for the adventuring party. Becky and Carolyn head back to their camp; David and I grab our bikes and head to the temple yard.
   4:30am: Connecting with David in the yard outside the temple, reaffirming our relationship needs and expectations for the coming weeks.
   5:00am: Back at camp, turning in for the night.
   Noon: Woke up rested, greeted Marissa on the way back from the portos!
   1:00pm: Breakfast of a burrito offered by David.
   1:30pm: At the Moonrock mixer catching up with Devon, Marissa, Billy, Trede, and Jack.
   2:45pm: Heading to center camp with Zobeewa to do some further research on the solar array, check in on my father, and download another firmware patch for the internet relay antennas.
   3:00pm: Stumbled upon a wireless access point for the Artery. Head there, check in, and use their network access to get answers on solar and router questions. Learn that my father made it through his heart surgery on Monday with no complications. Breathe.
   4:00pm: Back at camp, bypassed voltage regulator in the primary charge controller.
   4:45pm: Repairs complete on the solar array. Letting it run before making another pass of voltage tests on the battery.
   5:30pm: Nym showing me photos of some of his noise shows in Japan on his phone.
   6:30pm: Learn that Inflection has some busted ropes that we need to fix.
   7:00pm: Back at inflection, patching a broken handrail and digital clock line on the side lights. Quickly head back to camp to get soldering stuff.
   7:30pm: First asthma attack on playa. Sitting offline, struggling to breathe for just under an hour.
   8:30pm: Standing on the top of a ladder in 20MPH winds, soldering low-voltage wires using tools held in my hands and teeth. Guessing at voltages, since I couldn't find my meter back in camp.
   9:30pm: Lighting and handrail repairs complete. Return to camp.
   10:00pm: Relaxing in the Tautology cuddle pool with Lucretia and David.
   11:15pm: Start getting ready to check out some deep playa art with Lucretia.
   11:45pm: Heading out with Lucretia, talking about camp questions and next projects for the collective.
   
   Tuesday 9/1
   -----------
   12:30pm: Lucretia getting cold checking out deep playa art. We head to Pink Heart.
   1:00am: Get to Pink Heart. Way too many people and too much noise for me to be able to focus. Incompatible needs for tonight, I say goodbyes and head out.
   2:00am: Back at camp after some wandering and reconnecting outside of Pink Heart with Lucretia.
   3:30am: Finally able to sleep
   11:00am: Wake up, wash up, change, and start cleaning and organizing the disarray in my tent after build week. And sweeping out a quarter inch of dust.
   2:00pm: Tent finally clean; I can find everything I need. Lunch of hot dogs from David!
   2:15pm: Fielding some medical questions from campmates.
   2:30pm: Solar array back online, radios charging two at a time so they should be ready by Inflection burn. Most of them lasted most of build week before dying.
   3:20pm: Nap.
   4:00pm: Woken by Lia to solve another bridge problem. Broken rope on a running line. Skipping scheduled perimeter training to attend to this.
   4:30pm: Found Trevor, who needs a break from leading bridge stuff today. I tell him I'll lead this one. I round up a fid, some rope, two folks who can splice (Daniel and Jake), some tape, ratchet straps, solder, e-tape, a soldering iron, and wire strippers. Headed back to the bridge.
   4:45pm: Arrive at bridge. Main running line at the first anti-manward twist is worn down to half an inch! We shutdown the bridge, setup a safety perimeter, and figure out who's doing ground and splice support.
   7:00pm: Repairs still underway, run into Olga! Catch up for a few moments, exchange addresses and affections.
   7:30pm: Fueling and starting generator, howling at the sunset.
   9:00pm: Bridge repairs complete! Heading to dinner with David.
   9:45pm: Date night with David! We head to the temple together.
   10:00pm: At temple, leave a stack of notes, Tamsin's envelope, and a photo of Nóirín Plunkett. The photo of my father stays in my pocket. Tear up a bit.
   10:10pm: Yet Another White Out Sandstorm. Stranded in the BRC holy of holies with my beloved. Nothing about this moment would I wish to change.
   10:50pm: Back at camp to warm up, Daniel, David and I decide to stop fretting over the bridge and try to relax and enjoy ourselves for a day or two before we burn it.
   11:00pm: Heartwarming conversation with Zobeewa before David and I depart again to check out more art.
   
   Wednesday 9/2
   -------------
   12:30pm: Run into Jenn and Jesse at that holo-tapestry project Kyle showed me on his phone. Impressed. Not too technically challenging, but very visually engaging. Nicely done, and very inspiring.
   2:00: Falling asleep in my tent.
   Noon: Woke up; David's cot collapsed and mine ripped, breaking a few fans in the process. Good thing I brought three!
   12:15pm: Have another look at the solar array. Confirmed this controller isn't charging this battery, either. It is powering inverters during the day, though, so let's leverage that.
   12:30pm: Lunch: Pretzels, pickles, and electrolytes
   1:00pm: Swapping out solar battery. Again. This is the last one we can test with, the fresh tertiary backup battery.
   2:00pm: Brief emotional breakdown in tent; at the end of my rope with this *&^%- solar array. No way to power the routers, antennas, stereo, or DJ controller we brought out here with us. Decide to sit and meditate for an hour.
   2:30pm: Cirque Gitane pumping septic right behind my tent. Leave camp, no destination in mind. Run into Tautology folks on the way, directing me to Sweet Spot for free margaritas. I could use one or two.
   3:30pm: Drinking at the Sweet Spot with Tautology and Potluck friends. Windstorm takes down their shade structure with us underneath. We all help them repair it and grab a second round before heading back to camp.
   4:00pm: Run into Mattress back at Tautology. Apparently the dick garden (part of the Inflection build's light garden, a field of solar-powered, illuminated dildos) has personally offended Larry Harvey and ruined one of his photo ops. They've ordered that we remove it. Censored by Burning Man!
   4:30pm: Gave Nym my bunny ears. Off to tent to finish patching some cryptosystems that need to be up by the time I'm back in Seattle
   6:30pm: Getting ready for birthday parties at Inflection. Trevor, Dano!, and Mattress all have birthdays this week.
   7:00pm: Celebrating birthdays. Raucous party at the bridge, connecting and sharing with lots of people from the project. This party stretches long into the night.
   
   Thursday 9/3
   ------------
   12:30am: Cuddle pile between Inflection and a visiting art car for a few hours.
   3:15am: Going out wandering with Daniel and Lauren.
   4:45am: Visiting Mazu temple. Lit incense and offered prayers and meditation.
   5:15am: Visiting the church with the organ. Attempt to play Beethoven. Organ appears to be broken. Repaired organ. Played organ. Moseyed on back to camp.
   6:45am: Sunrise on the Tautology pallet racking with Lauren and Daniel.
   7:00am: Sleep.
   10:00am: Woke up for the BMIR interview. Frantically dig around for the two-sizes-too-small bracelet that lets me into the station's recording studio. Can't find bracelet, I decide to stay back in camp.
   Noon: Morning routine and meditation complete. Ready for another day.
   2:30pm: We've won an award from Burning Man, we were censored by Burning Man, and I now learn that we're being shut down for safety reasons by Burning Man. I think we won burning man. We round up what we need to shut down the bridge and strip it of non-burnable materials 30 minutes before we were going to close it to prepare for the burn anyhow.
   3:00pm: Joined by Potluck folks (Mike, Patty, Nils, Giles, Marissa, Alina, Hilary) to help strip electronics from the bridge and run a final MOOP sweep.
   4:30pm: Bridge is secure and stripped everything we don't want to light on fire. Heading back to camp to eat and dress warmly (with no synthetic fibers, because fire will melt them).
   6:00pm: Back at Inflection for burn prep. Getting materials setup at the 9:00 side, loading kindling and solid fuel around masts.
   7:00pm: Mattress meeting with perimeter leads. I run a brief comm check on the radios. Two inoperative, I set about fixing them.
   7:30pm: Inflection burn perimeter goes up.
   8:00pm: Burn team (Mattress, Trevor, me, Daniel, Kendra, Gregg) in full fire gear, ready to place liquid fuel.
   9:00pm: Conclave begins.
   9:45pm: Conclave ends; Mattress and Nym place liquid fuel.
   9:50pm: Burn team cuts main support lines with machetes. I take my three lines out clean and fast--one hack, one break.
   10:00pm: FIRE. We light road flares on long poles and use those to light up the six standing masts, inner masts first. The fire spreads in minutes along the ropes. 
   10:15pm: The first five masts have fallen inward as planned.
   10:30pm: Most of inflection is down, waiting the last center mast to fall. Mattress heads out there to knock it over with a long pole.
   10:45pm: Inflection is down and the flame is now safe to approach. Perimeter falls.
   11:00pm: Companionship with David at the ashes of our art.
   11:30pm: After half an hour of searching, I locate my and Mattress's bikes. I bring his to him and head back to Tautology.
   
   Friday 9/4

   Midnight: Dinner at camp, soup crafted by Zobeewa and Donna. Eating with them, David, Dano!, Ashley, Devon, and Trede.
   12:30am: Asleep in tent.
   10:30am: Woke up, heading back to Inflection to check in and lend a hand with LNT efforts, cleaning up the ashes.
   10:45am: Ran into Danin and Ashley at portos. Hear that LNT is done. Head back to camp!
   11:00am: Found Joseph's bus parked next to Tautology where the Inflection truck needs to be parked in two hours. Help him move that (and all of his gear) 10 feet over so our truck can fit where it needs to go.
   Noon: Making plans with Mike Dodds to connect my unused sound and DJ gear to Potluck's Simon 2.0 art project.
   1:00pm: At potluck, Macguyvering Tautology and Potluck's sound equipment together with cross-connects that will allow Simon's flame effects to accent bass notes played from my and Dana's DJ gear. Sick.
   1:20pm: Solder together a cable to replace the one that ended up at Mars' house after Floodland.
   2:00pm: Margarita break at Tautology (Thanks, Allison!)
   3:00pm: Putting together a setlist in my tent of music that would sound good on a quartet of flamethrowers. 
   3:30pm: Leave my laptop with the rest of the audio gear at Potluck so I don't have to take it to Mazu burn perimeter with me.
   3:40pm: Confirm evening plans with Lucretia, meeting at Mazu at ten, or failing that, meeting at Simon at midnight. Nap time! 
   5:30pm: Finishing Lucretia's birthday present, the umbrella from Aphex Twin's video, Window Licker.
   7:30pm: Lucretia's present finished. Left it in front of her tent, heading to Mazu burn--the last day of the Buddhist temple across town. 
   9:00pm: Mazu burn perimeter orientation.
   9:15pm: Mazu burn perimeter goes up.
   10:30pm: Fireworks before Mazu burn.

   11:45pm: Perimeter down, fire now safe to approach. I find my bike (quickly this time, since I thought ahead and intentionally left the lighting effects turned on) and rush over to Simon to DJ a two-hour set on a rogue stage powered by a quartet of flamethrowers right off Esplanade.
