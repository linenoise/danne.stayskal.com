Howdy!

If your name is on the cc: line of this email, you've either asked me how Burning Man was this year, or I want to share with you how Burning Man went for me this year. If your name is on on the to: line of this email, your name is written somewhere in the little black book I carried with me everywhere during Burning Man. Not having the budget for playa gifts this year, I've decided instead to offer my writings to those of you who made this week so incredible.

Here are the curated and annotated contents of that book. I've made only the most cursory examination for typological, thinkological, and transcription(-ological) errors. Please forgive them, and I hope you enjoy reading about this experience! For those who've sent me other emails asking how the burn went, I will respond--just probably not tonight. In short, it was every kind of ephemeral beauty mashed together in the desert for ten days.

My love to all of you.

Saturday, 8/24
--------------

1:00am: Still packing, been up all night. Started burnlog notebook.
5:00am: Still packing. Most of the inventory spreadsheet ready to go, now rounding up food.
9:00am: Still packing. iPod appears to be broken. Burning CDs of road trip music, mostly non-electronic since there will be SO MUCH electronic music out there. My and Jenn's combined selections:
   * Iron and Wine - Around the Well
   * Kid Koala - 12 Bit Blues
   * Kollektiv Turmstrasse - Rebellion der Traeumer
   * The Mountain Goats - The Coroner's Gambit
   * The Mountain Goats - The Life of the World to Come

   * The Mountain Goats - We Shall All Be Healed
   * Paul Simon - Graceland
   * R.E.M. - Life's Rich Pageant
   * R.E.M. - Out of Time

   * Sigur Ros - Aegetis Byrjun
   * Tuneyards - Bird Brains
   * Tuneyards - Whokill
   * Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot
   * Zoe Keating - Into the Trees
Noon: Haven't slept, still packing. Texted Jenn saying I'd be late.
1:30pm: Somehow, everything I need to survive in a desert for 10 days fits entirely within my trunk, not accounting for shade, water, and human companionship, which will be mostly be supplied by Moonrock. Suspension's riding kind of low.
2:00pm: Arrived at Jenn's to pick up her and her gear.
5:00pm: We have somehow successfully crammed an entire trampoline into the back seat of my VW Jetta without significantly impairing visibility. The shocks, however, concern me.
6:00pm: Vegan tacos at Las Gorditas. Last real food for a VERY long time.
7:00pm: Jenn and I are Headed to Black Rock City, driving and napping in shifts.

Sunday, 8/25
------------
5:00am: Arrive at Black Rock City will call booth. Picked up Jenn's ticket. We decided to wait a bit for Jesse's gate shift to start so maybe we could catch him and say hello. Tested out radios.
6:15am: Head to the gate. No Wolfe to be found.
6:30am: Passed through the gate. I rang the bell and made a dust angel, since it's my first year.
7:00am: Found moonrock camp at 9:15 and Consumer. Setup my tent, cot, bed, and chairs where Galvin directed it should go.
8:00am: Went to park my car at 9:00 and Laissez-Faire since Moonrock was really short on space this year. Talked to the folks camping there, they said it was cool. Hiked back to camp. 
9:00am:  Having not slept other than a small handful of 30-minute bursts in the past 72 hours, I passed out on my cot.
11am-ish: Woken briefly by what I later learned was the camp shade structure going up above my tent.
1:00pm: Woke up and helped tie down the camp shade structure (it was huge!) during a brief rainstorm. Too hot to sleep, so I helped Mike and some other folks setup their tents.
4:00pm: Back to sleep. Woke up only once I realized the tent stays *way* cooler if I leave the windows unzipped a bit so the dustbreeze can get in.
11:00pm: Woke up, ate a can of soup, some vegan jerky, and some cliff bars.
11:30pm: Gone exporing on bike, getting navigational bearings on what large, bright things are closest to camp.
11:45: It starts to sink in that I am in fact not presently hallucinating--I am camping. With mostly strangers. In an electrified desert. At burning man.

Monday, 8/26
------------
Midnight: Came back to camp, found Ken and Dana in the livingroom. The three of us leave again to check out art and the temple.
2:00am: Back at camp, relaxing in the living room with Gorski, Pikul, and Trevor.
5:00am: Sleep.
Noon: Woke up, ate, cleaned, washed, changed, left camp to go find hacker-friends around town.
1:00pm: Found Paul Fenwick! Had numerous memorable hugs with one of my favorite people. Paul's hugs are fantastic, as is his company. If you've never shared one of either with him, I *highly* recommend it.
2:00pm: Made it over to the DPW Ghetto. Didn't see Erin or Cloe, left love notes with my address and the time of the moonrock burn for each of them.
2:30pm: Went to Center Camp looking for Noah, Corey, and Lexi. No luck, and no place to leave notes that I can find.
3:00pm: Looking for Saul's and Talena's camps. No dice.
3:30pm: Stopped back by camp to refill water. Biked around the perimeter of BRC (which was then L Street at the time) to get a sense of scale and take some photos for Jet.
5:00pm: Arrived back at camp from perimeter bike trip. Found Jenn. Rest for a few moments in the moonrock living room.
6:00pm: Jenn and I depart Moonrock for the opening fire ceremony.
6:15pm: We arrive at Center Camp having missed the ceremony altogether.
6:30pm: Serenaded by a jolly stranger who played for us the Pledge of Allegiance to the Unicorn Nation on an ocarina he wore around his neck.
7:00pm: It appears someone has setup a Buddhist monastary out here.
7:30pm: Whiskey "tasting".
8:00pm: Back at camp. Ate and rested for a moment. Ran into Schwern!
9:00pm: You only lose what you cling to.
9:30pm: Heading out with Jenn, Jesse, Xander, Szonic, and Ken to check out deep playa art.
10:15pm: Visited one of Moonrock's art pieces, the Ablation Cascade. Wasn't able to get a good photograph of it.
10:30pm: Jenn finds a giant neon dragon to ride.
10:45pm: The adventuring party sets off to rescue Szonic from a competing dragon who clearly must have run off with him!
11:00pm: Sidetracked by a brain. Jesse's brain, one of my absolute favorite art pieces out here (both in the signifier and signified senses). It's a giant glowing metal and glass sculpture of a human brain that illuminates according to brainwave patterns picked up by a headset worn by the observer.
   * Site: http://www.ma-brains.com/
   * Source Code: https://github.com/mens-amplio/mens-amplio
11:05pm: We get to watch Jesse's brain watching Jesse's brain watching Jesse's &lt;&lt;SEGMENTATION FAULT\nCORE DUMPED+++ATH0; 
Memory leaks in the desert, too. It becomes m00p.
11:15pm: Rode and pushed and pushed and rode a collosal stone merry-go-round contraption that loses both your bicicle and your sense of direction.
11:30pm: We determine that Consensus Reality (my personal favorite reality) is only but one of numerous viable possible constructs. We exist in many realities, and in some of them, this experience is outside standard parameters. Works Cited:
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_reality
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind%E2%80%93body_problem
11:45pm: The adventuring party, through a dustwind whiteout, happens upon a dragon that almost ate Jesse last year. No Szonic to be found.
Midnight: *illegible scribbles* bees *illegible scribbles* dinosaur bo *illegible scribbles* veMaria *illegible scribbles* headlamp batteri

Tuesday, 8/27

   * Offer to share my similar (albeit incomplete) derivation of the hypersurfaces of Minkowski spacetime if he can help me get past those pesky Pauli spin matrices. No response.
3:15am: "I'm in favor of confirmation bias. It's always worked for me!"
3:45am: Heaven is an infinite library ( with infinite indexes ( that are themselves indexed ( ( ( ( ( (
4:00am: Coffee at the Dust City Diner in deep playa. There is a Waffle House-style diner setup in the middle of a desert. Its sign is ninety degrees off-axis from the man, so it's only visible from deep playa. The menus are in French.

1:30am: Dancing at this front-half-of-an-airplane installation at 2:00 and esplanade. The couch catches fire. We move to some camp chairs. Crew can't be bothered to extinguish couch. Someone else drags it flaming into the playa while we try in vain to get directed attention of crew. We dance on over to the next dance camp.

   * Guy in the car behind me helps me fix my bike. The back wheel seemed to (literally) be about to fall off. Having already eaten the salty snacks past-me left for present-me, I offered him some electrolyte packets and cliff bars.
   * No matter what I do to this cheap handheld radio, it just does not want to pick up BMIR 94.5 very well.
   * Took notes of lots of new music to find and some to arrange for classical guitar
9:15am: Exodus ends after a brief and stress-free 8 hours. I am at the gravel road. Now to drive back to Portland! Yay!
2:00pm: Found a comfy looking patch of gravel just outside Klamath Falls. Took a 30-minute nap.
9:00pm: Arrived back in Portland at what appears to be my house. My key works, and that *does* look like my spice rack.
9:30pm: Spent some time with my turtle. Told him I missed him a lot.
10:00pm: Turn on tap in kitchen. THIS MASON JAR OF WATER DOESN'T TASTE LIKE DIRT WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? IT NEEDS ELECTROLYTE POWDER STAT!
10:15pm: Unloaded car.
10:30pm: Personal email triage. Sitting at 600 emails after filters across all active accounts. Moloch!
11:30pm: According to my notes, I've had 4.5 hours of sleep in the past 48 hours. Perhaps now would be a good time to sl
