    <p class="lede">Came out with my long-time friend Lawnchair's camp, Moonrock--while moving from Portland to Seattle--to my first burn. Overwhelmed by default-world changes and unable to reach out to connect, I spent a great deal of this burn alternating between having panic attacks in my tent and crying in deep playa. I met a lot of neat people, though, nearly all of whom I've stayed close to since then--especially so with the Potluck contingent who was camped with us this year, and with many old-school Moonrockers as well. My friend Reasonable from Portland, acting as my fairy ravemother for this event, is largely to thank for the modest amount of my emotional weight I was able to keep together this week. I decided that Black Rock City was a really neat place, but ultimately not my party. I didn't plan on returning.</p>

        <p>Haven't slept, still packing. Texted Reasonable saying I'd be late.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>1:30 pm</time>
        <p>Somehow, everything I need to survive in a desert for 10 days fits entirely within my trunk, not accounting for shade, water, and human companionship, which will be mostly be supplied by Moonrock.</p>
        <p>Suspension's riding kind of low.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>2:00 pm</time>

      <li>

        <p>We have somehow successfully crammed an entire trampoline into the back seat of my Volkswagen without significantly impairing visibility. The shocks, however, concern me.</p>

        <p>Vegan tacos at Las Gorditas. Last real food for a <em>very</em> long time.</p>

    <ol class="timeline">
      <li>
        <time>5:00 am</time>
        <p>Arrive at Black Rock City will call booth. Picked up Reasonable's ticket. We decided to wait a bit for Confused's gate shift to start so maybe we could catch him and say hello. Tested out radios.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>6:15 am</time>
        <p>Head to the gate. No Confused to be found.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>6:30 am</time>
        <p>Passed through the gate. I rang the bell and made a dust angel, since it's my first year.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>7:00 am</time>
        <p>Found moonrock camp at 9:15 and Consumer. Setup my tent, cot, bed, and chairs where History Dude directed it should go.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>8:00 am</time>
        <p>Went to park my car at 9:00 and Laissez-Faire since Moonrock was really short on space this year. Talked to the folks camping there, they said it was cool. Hiked back to camp.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>9:00 am</time>
        <p>Having not slept other than a small handful of 30-minute bursts in the past 72 hours, I passed out on my cot.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>11 am-ish</time>
        <p>Woken briefly by what I later learned was the camp shade structure going up above my tent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>1:00 pm</time>
        <p>Woke up and helped tie down the camp shade structure (it was huge!) during a brief rainstorm. Too hot to sleep, so I helped Professor and some other folks setup their tents.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>4:00 pm</time>
        <p>Back to sleep. Woke up only once I realized the tent stays <em>way</em> cooler if I leave the windows unzipped a bit so the dustbreeze can get in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>11:00 pm</time>
        <p>Woke up, ate a can of soup, some vegan jerky, and some cliff bars.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>11:30 pm</time>
        <p>Gone exploring on bike, getting navigational bearings on what large, bright things are closest to camp.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <time>11:45 pm</time>
        <p>It starts to sink in that I am in fact not presently hallucinating&emdash;I am camping. With mostly strangers. In an electrified desert. At Burning Man.</p>

      <li>
         <time>1:00 pm</time>
         <p>Found AussieCrunch! Had numerous memorable hugs with one of my favorite people. His hugs are fantastic, as is his company. If you've never shared one of either with him, I <em>highly</em> recommend it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <time>2:00 pm</time>
         <p>Made it over to the DPW Ghetto. Didn't find anyone I knew, left notes with my address and the time of the moonrock burn for a few folks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <time>2:30 pm</time>
         <p>Went to Center Camp looking for some friends who work at the coffee shop. No luck, and no place to leave notes that I can find.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <time>3:30 pm</time>
         <p>Stopped back by camp to refill water. Biked around the perimeter of BRC (L Street) to get a sense of scale and take some photos for Sweetheart.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <time>5:00 pm</time>
         <p>Arrived back at camp from perimeter bike trip. Found Reasonable. Rest for a few moments in the moonrock living room.</p>

      <li>
         <time>6:00 pm</time>
         <p>Reasonable and I depart Moonrock for the opening fire ceremony.</p>
         <p>Overheard: <em>"What is this, the Olympics?"</em></p>

      <li>
         <time>6:15 pm</time>
         <p>We arrive at Center Camp having missed the ceremony altogether.</p>

      <li>
         <time>6:30 pm</time>
         <p>Serenaded by a jolly stranger who played for us the Pledge of Allegiance to the Unicorn Nation on an ocarina he wore around his neck.</p>

         <p>Back at camp. Ate and rested for a moment. Ran into Monk!</p>

      <li>
         <time>10:15 pm</time>
         <p>Visited one of Moonrock's art pieces, the Ablation Cascade. Wasn't able to get a good photograph of it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <time>10:30 pm</time>
         <p>Reasonable finds a giant neon dragon for us to ride.</p>

      <li>
         <time>11:00 pm</time>
         <p>Sidetracked by a brain. Confused's brain, one of my absolute favorite art pieces out here (both in the signifier and signified senses). It's a giant glowing metal and glass sculpture of a human brain that illuminates according to brainwave patterns picked up by a headset worn by the observer.
