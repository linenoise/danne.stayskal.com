      Howdy,

      Everything moves in loops: repetition, variation, evolution. This year, the theme is Radical Ritual. Stories are the roots of the sacred. Here we go! Every year at Burning Man, I carry a notebook and record everything that happens. And once I'm home, I type them in and send them to everyone I've run into on playa. At this point, y'all know the drill. :)
   
      We did the thing again. Tautology went out to the desert, placed at 9:15 and D to support 32 people who are supporting four art installations and one fire dance collective:
   
      * As One (lead: Jack), 
      * Conclave (which we count as "supporting an art installation" for accounting who's-doing-what in camp)
      * Starfield (lead: Lane, who's in another camp, but Dano and Ashley are in this one supporting this installation,
      * Synferno (lead: me), and
      * Web of Dreams (lead: Kendra),
   
      I was camp lead again, with Daniel as co-lead for spacing and placement. Most aspects of camp and the art our folks brought out were on time, spec, and budget, or very close. Our twelve camp role leads and seven collective leads really came together to make sure things worked cohesively the whole week. And we had a great time building art, running the sound stage and pirate radio station, and keeping our family tight. And I played another very well-received modern classical set, and played four hours of techno on MIDI-controlled flamethrowers.
   
      This was the hottest Burning Man in over a decade. The temperature broke triple digits every day, and it took three to four hours of keeping-cool self-care every day for me to retain my ability to walk all week. And this year, that was the case for almost all week, up until Sunday of temple burn when shade came down, but I was only down for a few hours.
   
      Our neighbors were Dreamscape (the other camp in the Black Rock City Science Center), Emergency Services (the medics across the street, where our sound stage was pointed), Sparkle Donkey village to the anti-clockwise side, and some art camps behind us across E street who we didn't really connect with much. Their camp lead was popped for drugs at gate in the truck carrying all of their camp infrastructure, and their desert was mostly empty most of the two weeks we were out there. Also, Tautology was surrounded by soup camps this year. Nobody went hungry. We adopted a few new folks from Dreamscape as well this year: SK and Ginny (same as last year), Andrew, Keaton, and Scar.
   
      Also, there's a person who came out this event with me. She's very secretive, so I'm using the playa name she chose for herself ("Kafka") in these notes rather than her default world name. She was my grad school sweetheart back at U.Texas, and we were engaged to be married until she graduated and had to leave the country in 2010. We spent seven years trying to get her back here, through Muslim bans, immigration lawyers, numerous consulates and embassies, and countless family fiascos. We stayed in touch over Skype, since she couldn't come back here (for exit visa reasons) and I wasn't safe (LGBT-wise) in the countries she was able to move to. I was able finally to co-sign on her visa in November. Our plan was to see if we still worked as a couple, and settle down together if things worked out. We'd known for some time that Burning Man would either be our honeymoon or our final goodbye. It ended up being the latter.
   
      A few big things changed between last year's burn and this year's: I now live with Kendra in Lynnwood, and now work as a Principal Engineer for Oracle. The months-long process of getting that job was punctuated by:
   
      * been fired on Valentine's Day when my old employer found out I'm lesbian,
      * being locked out of my life savings due to a name change in 2014, 
      * navigating the eleven-month process of renewing my passport,
      * navigating the four-month process of turning an interview into a start date for Oracle, and
      * couch-surfing most of the spring and summer, while 
      * storing all of my earthly possessions at the homes of six friends in four cities.
   
      Due mostly to hunger, I'm much smaller now than I was last year, but can again prove my identity. That part is nice. When I left playa last year, I fit into a size 22 comfortably. And I just got home and fit into size 14 jeans that my aunt gave me. I got a lot of "Are ... are you Danne?" and "OMG where is the rest of you?" and "Damn, girl, you need to eat something!" this year. And a lot of hugs. I did ask friends to help with food from time to time, but apparently not as much as I could've. Three close friends covered most of the $16,570 I lived on from December through August. With the new job finally started, though, things are well, well past "okay" again and back into "life is amazing" territory. It's been a very hard year, and I needed this burn to go well for a variety of reasons. It did not disappoint.
   
      Again this year, I'm heading straight to Imagine on Orcas Island from Burning Man. I'm sending these notes from a pit-stop at home for a few hours. Since I lived at my friend's old cabin on Orcas briefly over last winter while I was struggling to make ends meet, it's important to me to see these folks for our big annual island-family reunion. And I have parts to their lighting stage and one of the art installations for that festival in my trunk that need to go up first thing tomorrow morning for their schedule to stay on track.
   
      Taylor managed to grab a lot of good photos of the event this year that you should really check out. She's an incredible photographer, and all photos included in this email are from her:

      Once my four-hour techno and classical sets are mastered and ready for upload, I'll be posting them to my music site, as usual, http://linenoise.io/. Follow the RSS feed there (or subscribe on iTunes or Google Play) if you'd like to be notified when they're online! Or add me on Facebook, since I post about these there when they're up:

      Finally, this year, since I didn't know 100% whether I could go to the burn until I had a start date from Oracle (which I started at less than two weeks before leaving for the burn), I brain-dumped everything about my parts of how our camp runs into a few documents that are freely available online. These provide deep insights into how we do That Thing In The Desert (TTITD) each year:
   
      Tautology BRC Camp Guide 
   
      Tautology Radio Standards Guide
   
      Tautology Sound Systems Guide
   
      The thing it says on each of the camp guides also applies elsewhere, including here:

   BURNLOG 2017
   
   Sunday, August 20th, 2017
   
   9:00am: We start the process of loading the truck. I leave home to go pick up Taylor at her place so we can load the collective's sound gear that stays at her warehouse for the 50 weeks when it's not at Burning Man. She and I met when I opened for Filastine at a show at her warehouse a year and a half ago.
   9:30am: Pick up Taylor, smiling, and head to Phlogistan at the Big Building.
   10:00am: Arrive at Phlogistan and meet up with Giles, Mark, and Lia, who helps us get the Synferno towers onto Mark's truck.
   10:30am: Arrive at Mobius to pick up sound gear. Takes about an hour, since this warehouse is a rad place to hang out with awesome people.
   11:30am: Taylor and I swing back by her place to drop off some gear, then pick up burritos down the street before heading back to my place for truck load.
   Noon: Truck load officially begins. Kendra and Taylor and I are the only ones here right at noon, but Kendra and I live here, so hey. Tautology infrastructure is all here, Perpetual Thrill (formerly Moonrock) infrastructure is pre-loaded back by the chickens. Jack and I did that earlier last week. All of my and Kafka's gear is indexed, packed, labelled, and ready for load.
   12:30pm: Team starts arriving. I head inside and bring the home stereo speakers outside to get some music rolling for people. We start loading Web of Dreams onto the truck. Taylor and Marie help untangle a spool of rope that exploded on Kendra.
   2:30pm: Daniel leaves to go fill up the two 100# propane tanks, Wil fires up the grill and starts making food for he and Marie and anyone else who's hungry. We start loading conduit and shade now that most of the bins are in place.
   3:30pm: Randy and Kasia show up with their UHaul of stuff that goes on the truck. We stage that where that goes, and continue tetrising things onto the truck. Overflow starts rolling onto the bus.
   4:00pm: Daniel returns with propane filled and ready to go, The entire truck is loaded except for bikes and coolers that have to be loaded last. We start loading bikes. Randy climbs up on a ladder and alters the "Budget" logo on both sides: One says "Puget" and one says "Fudge." The camp truck is accordingly christened the Puget Fudge.
   5:00pm: Truck is loaded. On time and on spec, like just nearly everything else about every project involved in Burning Man this year for us. Travis, Taylor, Randy, Kasia, Kafka, and I sit and collect our thoughts. Travis tells everyone the story of how his and my lives intersected over a decade before we actually met. He eagerly recounts this to anyone and everyone who he meets who knows me:
   
      When I was twenty five (2005) as then a three-time college dropout, I was 
      working in an advanced systems research and development lab for a department
      of defense contractor. There, I built a system that stops bombs from going 
      off. Cellphone bombs (IEDs, or Improvised Explosive Devices), specifically: 
      explosives that are wired to cellphones such that a remote operator can place 
      it by a road, wait for a convoy to drive by, and remotely detonate it. My 
      device stops these by jamming radio communications over a large range.
   
      Travis is a friend of mine from the Seattle dance music community. We met a
      few years ago on the dance floor and immediately hit it off and became fast
      friends. When I was fired for being lesbian earlier this year and locked
      out of my life savings due to my name change in 2014, on the precipice of 
      being broke and hungry, Travis invited me over for dinner because he is a
      compassionate, caring, and very kind person. And an excellent cook, too!
   
      For many years, I'd known the statistic: my jammer system saved around 
      twenty thousand lives over the course of its field service. This system was
      the only way they could convince this pacifist hippie to research for DOD in
      the first place--designing things that save lives). And it's also the project 
      that led to my stroke in 2008 that cost me two spoken languages and my 
      ability to recognize faces. I finished university later that year, walking 
      the stage as soon as I was able to walk again after the stroke and six-month
      ascending paralysis that followed.
   
      Over dinner with Travis that night, we discovered that the system I built 
      was the one he used. It saved his life three times. My close friend is alive 
      because of a thing I built. And he's in my camp and in Conclave this year.
   
   6:00pm: Kendra and I compare notes on departure and arrival times, and finalize plans for the next 48 hours. I head to get dinner with Kafka, then return home for one last pass over the packing and camp spreadsheets. 
   11:00pm: Satisfied that everything is where it needs to go (on the truck, the bus, or in my car, or in the laundry bin waiting to be washed and packed), I inbox zero, todo-list zero, shower, and pass out hard.
   
   Monday, August 21st, 2017
   
   9:00am: Wake up for the eclipse, start my last load of laundry.
   10:20am: Eclipse as close to totality as we're going to get in Seattle. Head outside to play in the sunlight with Kendra and Kafka. Lights from the trees and pinhole hands-shaped-like-cameras look really neat in the light bathing us as if the sun was wearing sunglasses. The chickens don't know what to do with their new reality.
   11:00am: Eclipse pretty much done. Kendra seems to have misplaced her car keys, so I run her to work for her last shift before leaving for playa.
   Noon: Run to Harbor Freight to pick up a bunch of ratchet straps and bolts we need for the kitchen carports and Web of Dreams this year.
   noon: Run Kafka by Walgreens and the bank to take care of her last-minute tasks.
   12:30pm: Drop Kafka back off at home. She hasn't packed or prepared a thing. I again point her to her bins and to the spreadsheet of what's in them.
   1:00pm: Pick Kendra up from work, run back home to finish laundry and close loops on last-minute camp planning details, transpo threads, and people still looking for tickets. Got the Imagine lighting stage controller booting and transmitting an SSID. Quickly improvise a range test with the measuring wheel, my laptop, a USB battery, and a long-ish suburban street.
   4:00pm: Head down to Taylor's to pick her up, run to REI, and grab the last few things she'll need for the burn. Drop off the shoes and fan that camped out in my car overnight unintentionally.
   5:30pm: Head to the car wash to scrub and vacuum my car end to end.
   6:30pm: Kafka's gone from the house. I pick up Kendra to head to our last pre-playa dinner. Steak and eggs.
   8:00pm: Ryan coming by to watch the second to last episode of Game of Thrones with us while I hack out some maps for camp.
   10:20pm: Finalize and send out the tent map of The One Way Things Fit under the shade structure. Which, of course, will bear only cursory resemblance to what actually happens on the ground.
   11:00pm: Wondering where Kafka's at, she's been gone all day. Reach out over a few channels.
   11:20pm: Megan drops off her bins and bike, some hugs, and thanks.
   11:45pm: Kafka shows up at home from spending time with a friend, tired and ready to sleep.
   
   Tuesday, August 22nd
   
   midnight: Finished getting the new kitchen shade parts (ratchet straps and bolts from Harbor Freight) indexed, labelled, and loaded onto the bus.
   1:30am: Finished and sent out the surveying map so the landing team knows where things go in our 200x250ft plot of empty desert.
   
      Inline image 1
      Fig. 1: Tautology surveying map
   
   1:45am: Sleep, finally.
   7:45am: Woke up to alarm. Start doing what I can to get Kendra and Mark out the door in short order.
   8:00am: Kendra loads the coolers and gets her things staged onto the back porch so she and Mark can get them on the truck. Kafka offers to help with food, then turns and walks off when shown what to do, repeatedly. Kafka shouts at my roommate, then disappears for the remainder of departure prep.
   8:45am: Michael and Mark arrive and get their cars parked where they go for the next two weeks and load the remainder of their personal things onto the bus and truck for the journey to the playa.
   9:00am: Kendra injures her toe and I injure my left leg and left arm trying to get two very large, heavy coolers of frozen food through the house and to the staging area.
   10:00am: Everything going on the truck is on the truck! Coordinate arrival schedules with Kendra, Mark, and Michael: They should get there Tuesday night / Wednesday morning and start with shade and surveying early on Wednesday so shade should partially be up when I arrive later in the day. That means the person with heat-triggered Multiple Sclerosis (hi!) won't have to be the one setting up shade in the heat this year! And the house is cleaner than I've ever seen it. Kendra and I both deep-clean before leaving every year.
   10:30am: Camp truck leaves for the playa with Mark and Kendra onboard!
   11:00am: Not wanting to mess up the kitchen before we leave, I order Chinese takeout for lunch for me and Kafka.
   11:30am: Lia and Andrea arrive and load their things onto the bus.
   11:45am: Food arrives, Andrea and I quickly eat and clean up.
   Noon: Camp bus leaves for Black Rock City! 
   12:30pm: Hear from Andrea that she doesn't have her WAP. I check in with everyone else coming in early to make sure they have theirs, then rig up a printer to work in the garage, print her WAP, and leave it tucked under a flower pot on the back porch.
   1:11pm: Head to Taylor's for last-minute REI trip.
   1:50pm: Picked up Taylor and head to REI
   2:30pm: Her broken camp chair is exchanged for a non-broken camp chair. Drop her off, hugs and love exchanged, and headed home to nap.
   3:15pm: Back home, nap time!
   6:00pm: Woke up, finished final configurations of Imagine lighting stage controller (getting rails and fadecandy to work on a Raspberry Pi that's functioning as a WiFi hotspot).
   6:30pm: I load the car, lock the windows and house, turn off lights, and put the chickens to bed.
   7:10pm: Almost ready to leave, I learn Kafka didn't pack her passport. Since our tickets are at Will Call and she'll need that there, I tell her I can't leave until she goes back in to get it and bring it with us.
   7:20pm: Leaving for Black Rock City, Nevada with Kafka, via the grocery store. I learn that Kafka also didn't pack her bank card or any money and expected me to cover all of her costs without talking to me about it. I tell her again that I need her to be independent, and that Radical Self-Reliance is one of the ten principles. I'm surprised to hear her ask what the ten principles are, since she's told me she's read the guides. 
   7:50pm: I drive us back by home so she can get her bank card. I tell her that if I get paralyzed again at the burn, she'll still need to be able to catch her flight back to Stuttgart if I can't drive her home. She expresses surprise when I tell her I've been paralyzed at Burning Man before. I tell her it was in my 2014 burn log, which she's told me a few times that she read. Now, she tells me she didn't read them. Past this point, she becomes frustrated and stops talking to me.
   8:00pm: Fueling up in Lynnwood. I put on a three-hour ambient set and hit cruise control by Tacoma. It's a very long and very quiet drive.
   
   Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017
   
   2:45am: Pulled over to fuel up in Chenault, OR, just barely keeping from running out of gas.
   4:08am: Welcome to California!
   4:30am: Pulled over to sleep in a forestry service turn-off in Modoc National Forest.
   8:30am: Kafka wakes me up, complaining of no cell signal, internet access, hot breakfast, or coffee. I get my bearings and keep driving.
   8:45am: Pulled over at Chimney Rock Travel Center. I roll my pant legs back down over my rainbow socks. Kafka logs into their free internet and does things on her phone for half an hour or so while I wait in the car.
   9:45am: Pulled over at Rabbit Trax. I pick up a bottle of whiskey.
   10:15am: Nevada state line.
   10:28am: We're stopped by a small-to-medium-sized cattle drive (around 50 head) passing by our car heading the other way down the road.
   11:20am: In Gerlach, I hear from Kendra, Mark, Michael, and Daniel that they're running late and that I'll again be the first person on the ground. I send out the placement map to group chat so people know where to park when they arrive.
   11:24am: Notice the same cellular antennas next to the familiar microwave relay backbone in Gerlach. I check my phone, and the same dodgy "USA Comnet" cellphone "network" is what it's attached to with the same data problems as last year. Take note and share to the chat channel that we'll all have around 10mb of actual, usable bandwidth that we'll need to be sparing with.
   11:48am: Gate road. "Welcome to the vacant heart of the old west."
   12:08pm: Feet on playa, parked at Will Call. I pick up my ticket and vehicle pass, and put the pass on my windshield beneath the other one. This is my Volkswagen's last trip to playa--when I get home, I'm selling it and buying a truck. It's been three times: 2013, 2014, and this year. That's enough alkali dust for one lifetime for a vehicle.
   
      Inline image 11
      Fig 2: Dusty road cone at gate
   
   12:10pm: Many truths gradually come to light about Kafka's motivations and preparations for this event. In roughly chronological order:
   
      * She lied about her motivations to come back to see me, shedding light on why she made no effort to see if we're still compatible as a couple (which until now was what she'd claimed was the purpose of her trip). Of the ninety day visa I cosigned for her, she spent ten with me, and the rest as a tourist in other parts of the country.
      * She lied to me about her health problems that contraindicate her being on playa.
      * She made no effort to prepare for the burn and made sure she was out of town or out of the house while Kendra and I prepped and packed everything she'd need to survive, after agreeing to help with all aspects of preparation.
      * She regularly offered to help with food prep, then repeatedly refused or made conflicting plans when food prep was actually happening.
      * She regularly told me she'd organize and pack her own things, then refused to do so at any point.
      * She hasn't read the list of things I packed for her, despite telling me she had.
      * She hasn't read the survival guide, but regularly told me she had.
      * She hasn't read the camp guide, but regularly told me she had.
      * She told me she'd read my burnlogs, then later admitted that she lied about that, too. Note, I don't care whether she or anyone else reads them--I care that she lied about it.
      * She lied to her family and all of her and my friends about our relationship and its history, extensively and repeatedly.
      * She lied to her father the afternoon of truck load, two weeks after we agreed not to get engaged to be married again, telling him we're engaged to marry in October.
   
      Had more of these things come to light before we left, I would not have taken
      her to Burning Man with me. I'd have grabbed Taylor and carpooled with her,
      which was the original plan before Kafka said "nobody else in the car" at the 
      last minute.
   
      It would be hard to imagine a scenario in which she and I grew into less-
      compatible people to talk about building a shared life together.
   
   12:11pm: Kafka tells me not to talk about these problems with my friends, and I remind her that's not her decision. She tells me to remove Kendra from camp and from the collective, and I fail to contain my laughter. She tells me she no longer cares about me as a lover or friend. I nod quietly and keep driving. Seeing how she's lied to and exploited me and so many of my friends to get herself a free ride out here, it becomes clear we'll at very least need some space from each other at this event.
   12:12pm: Back on gate road, heading to gate. I fill Kafka in on the basics of playa survival (how to use the air filter she hasn't setup, how to keep her feet from getting chemical burns, how not to get arrested or kicked out of camp, etc).
   12:48pm: At gate, they scan my ticket, WAP, and vehicle pass, and give me a blue EA wristband that says "It's not your job, it's only your turn."
   1:11pm: Greeters! I talk to Magic Lady to contact Papa Bear or Balknaub for placement.
   1:40pm: Found BRCSC, completely empty. I park in the back corner where cars go on our placement map and get out to meet the neighbors.
   1:50pm: Meet Logan, our neighbor from Sparkle Donkey village and go over our layout and sound stage schedule. Nobody from our 9:30-side neighbors is here yet.
   1:55pm: Get back in the car, turn up both the AC and the techno, and sleep for as long as I can.
   4:00pm: Placers finally find me and confirm I'm in the right spot. I hear over comms trickling into my tablet that the bus and truck are on Gate Road.
   5:08pm: Camp truck arrives with Mark and Kendra onboard! They pick up on my frustrations with Kafka and quickly find the surveying wheel and flags. It takes us a few minutes to get to hugs.
   5:15pm: Kendra and I talk to our across-the-street neighbors (ESD) and tell them about our sound stage and basic schedule. They're totally on-board with our camp's art and ways of sharing it.
   5:30pm: Surveying mostly complete, camp bus arrives with Michael, Andrea, and Lia onboard!
   5:45pm: Victory manhattans with everyone who's setting things up--Michael, Andrea, Lia, me, Kendra, and Mark.
   6:10pm: We smell a propane leak on the bus and scramble to unload it into our fire lane. Lauren Magana stops by in the middle of this for hugs! Her fella Levi leads a small camp in our 9:00-side neighboring village.
   6:30pm: First asthma attack on playa, unloading shade cloth in a rush to make the truck not explode.
   6:45pm: Running shy on daylight, we start on the shade build.
   7:45pm: Lia, Andrea, and Mark on shade, Kendra sorting out our Gerlach water fill contact, Michael building the generator baffle, I'm sorting the bike mess to where it goes. Daniel and Jesse are stuck at gate. Everything's moving like lightly rusted clockwork! It's almost as if we know what we're doing at this point.
   8:17pm: Bike mess sorted into rows. Jesse and Taylor are going to weep when they see these rusted stallions.
   8:30pm: Michael, Kendra, and I finish the generator baffle; Daniel and Jesse arrive!
   8:45pm: Kendra uses her headlamp to help me replace the batteries in mine (the one Bill Ratcliffe gave me at ABD), and I use mine to help her replace the batteries in hers. Andrea has the first three conduit rows confirmed at tension, so we get to bungee ballin'!
   9:00pm: Lauren Magana brings her friend Megan over, who identifies her as the one with the Tegan and Sara haircut. Awesome. Make a note to connect with her later in the week. I setup the Behringer speakers to play some music, starting off with my set from Twilight Unity, then moving on to the set Emma and I played out at Chillography.

   9:45pm: Shade structure top entirely at tension! People are starting to ask where Kafka is, since it's her first year, she hasn't prepared a thing, and we haven't seen her in many hours. Everyone else is working on shade.
   10:45pm: Still no sign of Kafka, checked the car, truck, and bus.
   11:00pm: Shade lift! Kendra assembling uprights; Daniel, Jesse, Mark, Lia, Andrea, and I lifting and inserting uprights; Andrea walking around on drywaller's stilts to get the verticals at tension. Our team is amazing.
   11:30pm: Michael drills lag bolts into the playa where our shade structure anchors in, saving us half an hour of pounding on rusted rebar.
   11:48pm: Side-walls starting to go up; Jesse taking point on that while I sort the rest of the shadecloth to where it goes.
   
   Thursday, August 24th, 2017
   
   12:30am: Wil and Marie arrive! Kendra starts setting up her tent since she's got an early gate shift tomorrow. Those not on shade side-walls follow suit. We fire-brigade bins off of the truck to where they go in camp, for those who are here.
   12:45am: Kafka reappears while I'm alone refilling water on the truck and asks when her tent will be setup so she can sleep. I tell her tents will be unloaded next, and she can set hers up then or she can sleep in the car. She goes to sleep in the car. I move her stuff to the opposite end of the shade structure from me and Kendra and update the camp map.
   1:00am: Dreamscape truck arrives! Say hello to Gwen and Basil.
   1:15am: Tetris layout of the Daniel--Aditya wall of shade so everyone fits now that Petr and Rachel are sharing a tent.
   1:30am: I setup my tent, which still has a considerable amount of MOOP on the bottom from Critical. I take note to sweep that extra hard. Setting things up, it's starting to look like a home again.
   2:00am: Say hello to SK, Keaton, and Sarah Cookies! Yay!
   2:15am: Setting up tent basics: blankets, cot, water, lights, desk, Buddha statue.
   3:00am: Lay out tomorrow's change of clothes and pass out hard in bed.
   10:00am: Woke up to people talking in the social area. I can see The Man from the back window of my tent.
   10:30am: Breakfast of gluten-free apple pie and catching up with Wil, Marie, Kendra, and Andrea.
   11:00am: Unload all of the stuff from the truck that doesn't need to go back to Gerlach for water fill (radios, food, evap pond, etc).
   11:20am: Jesse has my bike ready!
   Noon: Setting up and unpacking tent stuff
   12:14pm: Found my watch! Yay! I tape it to the front of my notebook. Same as it ever was.
   1:02pm: We have a working evapotron for the first time ever! Thank you, Andrea! She even 3d-printed many of the parts required to make this thing work out here.
   
      Inline image 2
      Fig 3: The dusty evapotron
   
   1:21pm: Truck leaves for Gerlack to fill our 55-gallon drums with water.
   1:30pm: Lay down in my tent until my back stops hurting.
   2:14pm: Back pain subsides, sunscreened, electrolyted, changed.
   2:17pm: Everything here looks like it's on schedule and has full build teams, so I go to help Dreamscape setup their shade structures to put some space between me and Kafka.
   2:32pm: Daniel stops by Dreamscape to tell me my car tire is flat. I thank him for letting me know.
   2:47pm: Dreamscape's un-tethered carports blow away, now three years in a row. Time to meet the neighbors! I chase down the tumbling carport with SK, Keaton, and the neighbors, then back to Dreamscape to connect with SK for a bit.
   3:30pm: Returning from talking things over with SK, having had time to do the same with Kendra and David, and had a few nights to process my own thoughts on things, I decide to cut ties with Kafka. I can't hold space in my life for people I can't trust to always be honest. Our collective's namesake and symbol is a mathematical definition of truth. She couldn't be less compatible with us. I login briefly and block her ability to communicate with me through all digital media and talk to Michael to arrange for her to ride back on the camp bus.
   4:00pm: Jack and David arrive! Hugs all around, and I show David where his tent goes and Jack where his camp goes within our camp.
   4:10pm: I'm literally surrounded by sweethearts: Kendra on one side, David across from me, and Taylor on the other side. Everything is going to be okay.
   4:30pm: I find David and fill him in on things with Kafka, and that I'd like to be able to rely on him, Taylor, and Kendra for emotional support to help get through the week. He joyfully says he'd love to help, as always.
   5:00pm: Heart-talk with David and Andrea in my tent. Laying down again until back pain stops again.
   7:00pm: Woke up, back pain subsided again. Kendra is back from gate and Taylor has arrived! I show Taylor where her tent goes and help unload. Note that she'll be coming back to Seattle in my car rather than Kafka. Fill her in on the Kafka situations.
   8:00pm: Lauren Magana comes to get me to introduce me to her fella Levi. We find Alexa on the way and say hello there as well!
   8:30pm: Hanging out in front of camp, watching the last light of the sunset with Kendra, David, Taylor, Wil, and Marie.
   8:55pm: Camp truck shows up back in camp with all of our water barrels filled! They got stuck in gate for five hours.
   9:00pm: Ziko shows up! Introductions all around. And dinner is done: beef stew and brisket. OMG, I feel human again.
   9:30pm: Walking with Taylor and Ziko down to Space Virgins to pick up Taylor's bike from Ziko's van. Met Ziko's friend TJ, here from Barcelona.
   9:45pm: First bike ride on playa, with Taylor, heading back to camp.
   10:00pm: Hanging out with Taylor, Andrea, Kendra, Jesse, and Michael. Told the story of how me and Andrea first met in 2009:
   
      At a mutual friend's sister's Hindu wedding in Delaware, standing in the
      buffet line, I said hi to the lady standing in front of me. Thinking I heard
      her respond in Korean, I said "안녕하세요!", to which she responded in kind, 
      "안녕하세요!". Later in the evening, I learned she was an engineering student when
      she was dressed in a formal top, adorable red running shorts, tennis shoes,
      the only one dancing without restraint among an otherwise very conservative 
      dance floor. I still have at home the scrap of paper on which I wrote down
      her email address before leaving.
   
      And as it turns out, she wasn't in fact originally addressing me in Korean.
   
   11:00pm: Joined by Jacob and Daniel and eventually Jack as well, we go over the story of how Jack and I first met and how Tautology came to be:
   
      While I've known Jack since 2000 through our old writing community,
      Everything2.com, we only first met at a house party in Ohio in July, 2001
      in Columbus, Ohio. This was back when he lived in Kansas and I in Texas. When 
      he and I lost a long-term close friend in 2013, Matthew, I moved up to 
      Seattle from Portland to be closer to him and his communities. In short, Jack
      is why I live in Seattle. And it's good to be sharing a camp with him again.
   
      He first invited me out to Burning Man in 2010. With heat-sensitive MS 
      (ascending paralysis, specifically) and asthma, it took a few years for me to 
      figure out how to survive there. And in 2012, I had a ticket and was ready to 
      go when I found out the Republican National Convention was the same week.
      I was on schedule with March Hare to run maps and comms for its protest.
      So, my first burn was instead in 2013, with his camp: Moonrock. I carpooled
      out with Jenn Dolan, which began a pivotal few weeks in my life. 
   
      That year, Jenn and Jess took me out to see playa art for the first time,
      and I was so inspired by what I saw that I decided I need to help build this
      community. After spending five years designing equipment for war zones for
      Department of Defense, building things that could survive here was already
      something I was intimately familiar with. And ever since a friend of mine
      in Portland (Suzy) introduced me to the Oulipo, I'd been looking for an 
      opportunity to put together a mathematician-artist collective.
   
      That next year, in 2014, my friend Kent got an art grant for an installation 
      called Silk Road. He invited me to be his lead engineer. The three of us,
      me, Kent, and Trevor (with his own inflectionally twisted machinations in
      mind for next year), founded the Tautology Arts Collective since there were 
      a bunch of people from Kent's team that also wanted to work on Trevor's
      build. Kent and Trevor were leads on granted art installations, and it was 
      my job to get the collective off the ground and keep it running smoothly.
    
      Our purpose: create the art we want to see in the world, share resources 
      and expertise between build teams, and bring out awesome art support camps
      to any event that'll take the art made by our artists and their build crews. 
      That year, 2014, had Tautology's first mini-art-support camp, for Silk Road,
      nestled lovingly within Moonrock's placement in Black Rock City Science
      Center's first village.
   
      The next year, 2015, Black Rock City Science Center hosted numerous other
      theme camps and art support camps, all run by people who came from Jack's
      camp, Moonrock.  In 2016, we came back with WoD and a deep playa temple.
   
      This year, we're hosting the Moonrock sign and ours next to each other.
      That's one of my favorite parts of this year. 
   
   11:30pm: Jesse breaks out some cold, homemade dill pickles. We have our first round of picklebacks this year: A swig of whiskey followed by a gulp of pickle juice. Jesse even brought out his special pickle tongs for the occasion.
   Midnight: Back in my tent, out like a light.
   
   Friday, August 25th, 2017
   
   2:00am: Woke up cold and ate some pretzels. Taylor and Andrea are still up talking outside my and her tents, discussing hyperintelligent AI and herds of buffalo. Passed out again quickly after getting some calories in me.
   9:00am: Woke up again to Taylor making everyone coffee. Wash up, change, sunscreen, and get ready for the day.
   9:30am: Human-ish again, step outside to see Ginny has arrived! Say hi to her, SK, Keaton, Basil, and Gwen, and sit down to catch up a bit.
   10:00am: Quick breakfast of bacon with Taylor.
   10:15am: Headed to Ranger Station Tokyo with SK, Ginny, Scar, and Keaton to request trenching for my installation (Synferno) in camp.
   10:20am: At Tokyo, the rest peel off to head to center camp. I talk with Ranger Junkyard about our trenching needs. He radios placers to contact HEAT (heavy equipment on playa) and gets us on the list. They can't pronounce my name over the radio and write down to ask for "Danah" at Tautology's camp.
   10:26am: Back at camp, I deputize my build team (Michael and Daniel) as "Acting Danah" in case HEAT shows up while I'm off doing something else.
   10:30am: Debugging Wil and Marie's radios--one of them has a broken PTT contact switch that I'll need to re-solder when I get to soldering things later in build week.
   10:40am: Breakfast picklebacks and finishing truck unload.
   11:00am: Allison, Aislinn, and Travis arrive! They quickly get to setting up the kitchen carports.
   11:30am: A man rides by on D street with his head protruding through the rungs of a ladder like a necklace in the morning sun. Artist? Build team member?
   12:45am: Travis breaks out his didgeridoo. There is no didgeri-try.
   
      Inline image 4
      Fig 4: Travis AKA Poombah AKA Roomba
   
   1:00pm: Kitchen carports are up! We have a kitchen. :)
   1:20pm: Wil chases the street-watering truck, naked. Because Free Wil is very free.
   2:00pm: Mid-day chilling with friends in camp. Between 2pm and 6pm, it's pretty close to useless-level hot for everyone. This is one of the hottest burns I've been to so far, never before have I worn shorts at midnight here.
   2:15pm: Jesse announces the trencher will be here in one hour!
   2:45pm: Anticipating that we'll have the trenches done soon (which is blocking our vehicle positioning, which is blocking power grid setup), I decide to turn on and hand out our radios. Our last batch of radios went out to Standing Rock (along with our solar arrays, antenna mast, wireless networking gear, and old pirate radio transmitter (which powered Radio Free Standing Rock)). This year, we have ten shiny new radios that I quickly baptize in dust. Linenoise, on-comm. 
   3:15pm: The trencher visits our neighbors (whose address is also 9:15 and D), do their trenching, then leave before Michael thinks to chase them down. I don't even notice.
   4:20pm: Michael and I run down to Ranger Station Tokyo to confirm trencher is still coming at some point today. They tell us we're still on the list and that they're of course very busy.
   4:45pm: Dinner of tamale, sausage, and cheese.
   5:30pm: David returns from Jack's build site, telling us that a blown-over piece of metal broke a window in the truck. Burning Man is where all vehicles come to die--not just bikes.
   6:00pm: Michael relays that we get trenching today, still. I lay down for a nap.
   7:45pm: Woke up ready for the evening. I learn that a woman came by with a forklift asking what we needed lifted. We sent her on her way.
   8:30pm: Web of Dreams has a full build complement, scaffolding mostly arranged into the correct shapes, with David directing things on the ground while Kendra's at one of her gate shifts.
   9:00pm: WoD scaffolding is 90% up! Michael tells us we won't get trenching today. They did cross us off at 3:15 when they trenched our neighbors, and when we returned to confirm, they got us on the forklift list rather than the trencher list. They apologized profusely and promised we'll have trenching first thing in the morning.
   9:05pm: Michael has his media center playing 90's hip hop through my monitors.
   9:15pm: Swapping Michael's broken mixer out with my shiny new PA mixer with knobs that aren't even hard to turn from dust build-up yet.
   9:45pm: Our across-the-street neighbors, ESD, come over and unplug our sound gear while we're away. We will have a conversation about this in the morning. During build week, we don't run sound after 10pm, but during burn week we keep to the rules: 90 decibels at 20 feet. And we use calibrated meters to stick to that.
   10:15pm: We have a rousing game of "Marco! Fuck you!" as Jesse gets lights up in camp.
   11:30pm: Hot dogs with Jack, Michael, and Jesse in a now well-illuminated social area under the shade.
   
   Saturday, August 26th, 2017
   
   Midnight: Dano and Ashley arrive! We remove a section of shade support so they can build their yurt. Never before have I needed fans on in my tent to stay cool at midnight during Burning Man.
   12:30am: I go out to duct tape the hose clamps on WoD, then realize they're not tightened down yet since the second floor of the installation isn't fully arranged yet.
   1:00am: Flitter arrives! With Kendra! They just got off their gate shifts. I introduce Flitter to Taylor and Jesse. Long hugs with Flitter, my cuddle friend, playa sweetheart, and one of Burning Man's payroll accountants.
   1:25am: Yurt raising with Dano, Ashley, Jesse, Jacob, and Andrea.
   1:45am: Kendra drunkenly regaling us with tales of her gate shift.
   2:15pm: I retire for the evening and quickly pass out in my tent.
   9:40am: Woken by the heat, start getting ready for the day.
   10:05am: Trencher shows up while I'm still getting changed;
   10:20am: Ready to be social Kendra tells me the trencher was run by a gorgeous tattooed woman. I ask her kindly to notify the camp lesbians the next time something like that happens. I'm on-comm 24/7 at this event. :)
   10:30am: Skylar is here with Dreamscape! I'm on the bus with Michael and Andrea trying to get it to start. Kendra climbs on the bus, hits the start button again, and it starts. She's got the touch.
   11:00am: Moving the bus into place, load-balancing power grid drops, routing flamethrower control and supply lines.
   11:30am: Jack is back and headed to gate. It has to be at least 95 degrees out, completely baking and breezeless.
   12:45am: Synferno flamethrower towers are in place and hooked up! Starting to move speakers into place as well. It still feels weird to use the phrase "my flamethrowers."
   1:30pm: The breezeless heat can only be described as "sweltering", and seems like it's in the triple-digits already. Out in front of the bus, building sound shade with Michael. Each time my leg touches a piece of our stainless steel conduit, I'm reminded of the vinyl seats in my dad's oldsmobile as a child in Texas when shaded parking wasn't an option.
   1:35pm: Andrea moves our sign out front because people keep tripping over it. We briefly discuss ways to improve its electronics.
   2:04pm: Synferno dry test complete: both solenoids clicking on tempo, on calibration!
   2:22pm: Synferno production flame test complete! Used Plastikman - Pakard playing through a blown monitor as a test track. Shared "fuck yeah" hand gestures with Jack walking by down below, and hugs with Michael and Daniel on top of the bus.

   3:05pm: Boiling breakfast and lunch. Brisket and burrito.
   3:15pm: Grace stops by! I say hello while quickly inhaling food.
   3:40pm: Doing dishes, cleaning up, and quickly fall into a food coma nap in my tent.
   6:45pm: Cooled off, closing loops via email with people still on their way into camp. Alex will be bringing in a few coolers of fresh fruit and vegetables when he comes in on Wednesday.
   7:15pm: Run into SK out front of camp and confirm placement for Danielle's sub-camp moving to his D-street frontage rather than our E-street back lot. That should leave room for everyone.
   7:30pm: Headed to the den to cuddle with David and talk through some family stuff.
   8:30pm: David and I hook up the sound stage.
   9:00pm: Sound check, all systems go! Reference track: Erothyme - Thousand Hands of God.
   
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXKGnKq5J88
   
   9:15pm: Staging to actually Go To Burning Man with David, Lia, Andrea, Taylor, Travis, and Starfish.
   9:35pm: Headed to portos with David, got radioed back to camp while using the restroom, Flitter is there!
   9:45pm: Hugs with Flitter, and I invite her to join us! Also joined by Mark and Michael. Travis and Starfish head to another camp to grab a friend of theirs. We decide to time-box our waiting for them to ten minutes.
   9:55pm: We go to Burning Man without Travis or Starfish.
   10:05pm: Came upon a spinning swing installation. Got on and went around a few dozen times, then started feeling dizzy and nauseous and dismounted semi-gracefully. Lia kept both of our balances for us for many moments.
   10:16pm: At the man base, still under construction. Flitter and I agree that we'd like to make plans for an Oakland visit later this year. I need to go down there to see Lauren as well.
   10:30pm: Tree of Tenere, still under construction. Breathtakingly gorgeous, very nice physical design and build work, nice refresh rates on their LEDs, and graceful algorithms keeping everything in sync. Very nicely done.
   
      Inline image 8
      Fig 5: Tree of Tenere, Under Construction
   
   10:45pm: Flower temple behind the main temple, both of which actively still under construction. Both are exquisite and mesmerizing.
   11:05pm: Trash fence with Flitter and Taylor. This is the first time I've ever seen the stars above Black Rock City (now that I have new glasses, since my old ones were seven years old). Stand in awe and silence. 
   11:17pm: Found the blind tiger close to 12:45 and the trash fence. Waypoints: the man --> the temple --> rainbow pyramid --> temple of gravity --> bearing to 2:00 from the man.
   11:21pm: The Temple of Gravity. A team has suspended giant slabs of rock from a very large metal tower with a fire hanging from a chain in the middle. Flitter tells us this one came out in 2007 and has been sitting in a warehouse ever since. They rebuilt the hub and set it up out here weeks ago. I can imagine the feats of engineering that went into setting this up, but cannot figure out where their fuel depot is. Did they bury multiple 100# propane tanks? Is that actual wood actually burning in the middle?
   
      Inline image 7
      Fig 6: Temple of Gravity
   
   11:45pm: Flitter heads home for the night, since she's operating on basically zero hours of sleep.
   11:50pm: Rainbow serpent floor, appears to be by the same team that made the hopscotch installation I saw with Moonrock on Thursday night in 2014 with Becky and Chunter. Andrea debates whether to bug their engineer about their use of weight or capacitance (or both) sensors and inter-pad communication, then decides against it (so they can focus on their work) and we move on.
   Midnight: Back in camp, Taylor expertly adjusts my bike seat to the correct height for my height so my knees stop hurting.
   
   Sunday, August 27th, 2017
   
   12:30am: Dinner with Jacob, Mark, and Taylor in camp.
   1:00am: Lauren stops by for drunken camp chair cuddles and is joined by Kendra. I am literally surrounded by love. Lauren and I sport our trusty lesbi-flannels. And Taylor captures a photo.
   
      Inline image 10
      Fig 7: Drunken camp chair cuddles (Danne, Lauren, and Kendra)
   
   1:15am: Kendra heads to bed and Lauren back to her camp.
   1:30am: Allison tells me we're running out of propane bottles, so I email out to the folks who are still on their way in to pick up an adapter so we can run the stove off our spare 40# tank. Then fall asleep on my tablet.
   8:00am: Woke up rested, happy, and ready to get a start on the day. Hair is a matted mess from being in a ponytail all week. Start typing in burn log until others wake up.
   9:20am: Aditya responded, confirming that he's ordered the hose adapter we need to be overnighted to his staging location in Los Angeles, and will pick it up there with his things when he drives in with Jad on Tuesday. 
   10:00am: Folks seem to be up and about in camp, so I finish getting ready for the day.
   10:15am: Kendra appears to have a full build team stitching on WoD.
   10:30am: Discussing Synferno design and system mechanics with Andrea.
   11:00am: Taylor works the knots out of my neck. She is incredible.
   11:15am: Michael tells me Kafka has been bugging him for WiFi access and locations so she can "surf the internet". I joke with him him that "tourist" is not a camp role we need filled. She apparently didn't install the Time to Burn app (that answers these questions for you) that I told her about twice and wrote about in the guide. When we left Seattle, she told me she did install it. When we got to gate, she admitted that she lied about that, too. Thankfully, I've barely seen her in camp since everyone set everything up for her. And when she is here, she mainly hangs out in the kitchen. This means I regularly delay eating and hydrating, but it keeps the peace for now.
   11:30am: Confirming Wednesday food delivery list with Alex.
   11:41am: Confirming transmission frequency of 104.7 for Shady FM with the Black Rock City Pirate Radio mailing list.
   11:56pm: Pirate radio station online and making waves! You're listening to 104.7, Shady FM. Now legal in most jurisdictions.
   noon: Gate opens for the festival, cell "network" promptly keels over and dies. I heat and eat a breakfast burrito. Metered sound stage to 80db at 20' with mains at 75%. Sounds awesome.
   12:20pm: WoD panels are all placed and tacked!
   12:30pm: Michael plays the first set on our sound stage and pirate radio station. Funk and soul. Keith Salender arrives!
   12:40pm: Kafka complains to Jesse about shade in the den.
   12:45pm: This is now officially the longest I've been on playa while retaining full use of both arms and both legs. Over the years, I've started to learn the signs that things are about to go very bad. I think three things are mainly to credit for this: our shade team, our centrally coordinated daily ice runs, and taking breaks during the parts of the day when things in my body start to drag and fasciculate. That's been within an hour of 3:30 each day, and three to four hours of rest and self-care seems to be all it takes for me to retain full function. Awesome.
   1:00pm: We place the WoD fuck-poline right on frontage between the main WoD and the Tautology sign that's leaning up against Perpetual Thrill's shade structure.
   1:05pm: Daniel returns from FAST with our Synferno laminate. Houston, we are clear to poof!
   1:10pm: Abstract stops by to tell me his talk proving the dimensionality of the Sierpinski gasket will be Friday at Noon at Miso Horney. I show him where I keep my whiteboard, give him a few of this year's Tautology patches, and make a note to attend and take notes for Trevor.
   1:20pm: Dreamscape having some trouble with their mirror lights. One of our best engineers, Andrea, heads over to help them debug.
   2:00pm: Sound stage lineup written up in sharpie on card stock.
   2:15pm: Walked the lineup and sound stage guidelines by our neighbors so their DJs can play as well! Dreamscape takes a full night again, which I'm really looking forward to. The best way to get your neighbors not to hate your sound stage is to let them play on your sound stage. :)
   2:20pm: We have a 16.9kW sound stage playing for a hot and empty group of nothing and nobody. Everyone in camp is under the shade, listening to the music Michael's playing (from his tablet, also under the shade) over a one-inch speaker on my HAM radio which is tuned to our pirate radio station. We decide to switch to the smaller generator to save fuel and only run the mixer, remote media center, and FM radio transmitter.
   2:30pm: Daniel heads to the fuel depot to get us on the list for fuel fills during the week using Jack's As One creds.
   3:00pm: Jenn Dolan and Jesse Wolfe have arrived! Give them the latest camp schwag, hugs, and direction on where their things go.
   3:30pm: Noticing slight delay and fasciculation in left leg. Retire to siesta in my tent for the rest of the afternoon. Refill medication organizers for burn week, clean up a bit, and lay down until my body feels human again.
   7:30pm: Woke up feeling good. Headed to the portos.
   7:45pm: Poop sauna. The nearest portos to us are also the nearest portos to our down-the-street neighbors, Distrikt. These will be unusable by Wednesday.
   8:05pm: Placing the Tautology sign that Andrea has freshly repaired as Jack rejiggers the propane line to his stove. The valve on his 40# tank is busted, so he borrows our spare from the kitchen.
   8:00pm: Kafka and I pass each other, otherwise alone in the back door of the shade structure. She says "hi" with falling intonation. I say "nope" with rising intonation and keep walking. It works out that these are our final words to each other.
   8:10pm: Catching up with Grace Jones out front of camp by the Perpetual Thrill shade structure as my heart rate returns to a resting normal.
   8:30pm: Spending time with Allison, Aislinn, Andrea, and Taylor talking about life with Autism and Savant Syndrome. Allison has an Autistic son, so we make plans to have them over for dinner once we're back in the default world. I take a note to send them the page of resources I maintain on how to work with the hard parts to have a happy, productive life.

   9:00pm: I decide to take a self-care night and stay in. Tautology's freshman class for this year are going to Burning Man together tonight. I stay in, finish typing in the burn log to this moment, and write out my calendar for burn week in my black notebook so I can stop carrying my tablet everywhere.
   11:30pm: Caught up on burnlog and planning, starting on other TODOs that have to happen before things get crazy busy in a few days.
   11:38pm: Harvested three handfuls of playa dust for Kris Acosta, a friend of mine from back home on Orcas Island.
   11:45pm: Start putting together lights and controllers for Ian's arches that are going to the Imagine gathering.
   
   Monday, August 28th, 2017
   
   12:07am: Some of the parts I need to finish Ian's build are on the bus, and I'm really in a not-leaving-my-tent kind of headspace. Make note to finish that tomorrow and get to designing my sets for Thursday and Friday. Daniel plays with the flame effects out front while Lia shouts "Freebird!". Sabotage by The Beastie Boys plays loudly from an art car off in the distance.
   12:13am: Track hunting through the mass of music I downloaded the night of truck load.
   1:09am: Sorting new music complete. Found 16 tracks worth playing in 20GB of downloaded material. Tagging and sorting target genres into stacks.
   1:57am: Full 180GB library tagged and ready to stack for sets.
   2:10am: Downtempo stack done.
   2:23am: Techno stack done.
   2:39am: House stack done.
   3:01am: Classical stack done.
   3:27am: Ambient stack done. Sets are ready for Thursday and Friday. Bedtime now.
   5:00am: Woke up, heard David reciting The Lorax to Mark briefly, then fell back asleep.
   9:30am: Woke up to Kendra telling people the high was 107 degrees yesterday (and should be about the same tomorrow). She tells people more stories about the airport as well! Sounds like a fun place to work.
   9:35am: Jesse stops by to make traktor-learning plans around eleven. Confirmed!
   10:00am: As ready for the day as I'm going to get.
   10:15am: Showing Edward (one of the DJs from Sparkle Donkey village) how to use my Traktor S5.
   10:40am: Petr and Rachel are here! I say hello as soon as I see them; apparently they got in last night and were the ones to borrow my air pump whose voices I couldn't recognize through the walls of my tent.
   11:00am: Stop by Dreamscape and let them know we're about to show people how to use the sound rig.
   11:15am: Synferno and sound rig training. All the gear overheats within 15 minutes, some of it was already too hot to run. We demonstrate what we can, and Michael and Jesse start designing shade for the sound gear table on top of the bus.
   11:30am: Body starting to overheat, noticing significant difficulty moving. Get down off the bus safely and back into the shade. I notice my spare hookup wire in the Synferno bin (that we need for one of the Imagine art pieces) and bring it back to my tent.
   Noon: Burrito lunch. Jesse helps me refill my water jug since it's a two-person job and my left arm isn't working very well. Tapped into water barrel number three of six.
   12:15pm: Squirt-mosas with Dreamscape! Said hello to Kazar.
   12:45pm: Jack has a mini IT department setup in the camp truck to work on his installation's software.
   12:50pm: Cooling off as much as I can, with fans, shade, no clothes, and wet towels in my tent.
   1:00pm: Wrote up calendar of camp events (Family night, Fire night, Adventure night, Man Burn, and Temple Burn) and hung it up in the common area.
   1:30pm: David stops by my tent and we catch up and talk about more family stuff.
   2:00pm: DeathBoy takes the stage, a dirty breaks DJ in from London. Killin' it!
   3:10pm: David heads back out to be social.
   4:00pm: Setting Jesse up for his motown set. Mention to he and Michael on the way that the improvised shade up there looks like exactly what's needed! I last about 15 minutes on top of the bus again before noting weakness from heat, quickly sound check and head back to shade.
   5:10pm: Volume inconsistency reported between channels. Get minor cuts and bruises on left arm getting up and back down the bus again to normalize channel gains, then pass out hard in my tent.
   5:45pm: Woken up by quiet, Jesse brings my laptop, music drive, and power supply back and I pass out again until sunset.
   7:15pm: Woke up when Taylor and Andrea got home again! Figured out which boundaries I need to communicate to Kafka, but not yet how or when.
   7:30pm: Talking with Kendra at WoD about her gate shifts, rescheduling our temple date to accommodate gate schedules.
   7:45pm: Spending time with Taylor in my tent, talking through family stuff.
   8:20pm: Decide I need to circle up the leads of the collective who are on playa this year to address Kafka's freeloading and violent patterns.
   8:30pm: Lauren stops by to invite us to dinner at Sparkle Donkey. I grab my spork and bowl and start heading that way.
   8:45pm: Web of Dreams is done, says Daniel with a huge smile!
   
      Inline image 12
      Fig 8: Web of Dreams, or the top-left 15% of it this year
   
   8:55pm: All leads of the collective who are on playa this year (other than David, so far, since he's not around) are onboard for a circle tomorrow at noon. David and I already have standing emotional check-in plans daily at noon, so I figure it'll work out.
   9:00pm: Dinner with Lauren, Megan, Petr, and Rachel at Sparkle Donkey. Forgot to ask for Megan's email address again, but with more stuttering this time. Really engaging conversation with Petr on cloud systems architectures and with Rachel on computational genetics. It's too loud for me to be able to eat watermelon (the bass from their kitchen speaker obscures the part of my field of vision that needs to be busy reading lips, so there's no room to navigate eating a large piece of fruit).
   9:45pm: I bring the watermelon back to Tautology and share it with Taylor.
   10:00pm: Catching up with Mark, Taylor, Andrea, Jacob, Dano, Ashley, and briefly SK as well.
   11:15pm: Dano and Ashley leave to go check out Temple of Gravity. That seems to be one of the big ones people are attracted to this year. 
   11:30pm: Taylor and Andrea take off to see Scar and SK play on the other side of town. I retire to my tent for noon-circle planning and self-care, getting my body back to full functioning.
   
   TuTuTuesday, August 29th, 2017
   
   1:30am: Taylor and Andrea return from the happy hardcore show. I spend some time with them and Mark in the den before retiring to finish planning the meeting.
   3:30am: Planning more or less complete. Fall asleep in my tent.
   9:15am: Woke up to Taylor talking outside my tent. Start getting ready for the day.
   9:45am: Checked the forecast with the last shred of bandwidth I can squeak through my tablet. High of 97 degrees with a 20% chance of rain between noon and 6pm.
   11:15pm: Finished planning the noon meeting of the collective's leads, and got everything to fit on one screen, proposing that we need to remove Kafka from camp over her dishonesty, exploitation, manipulation, abuse, freeloading, and patterns of violence. Very few folks are comfortable with her being here, and I've received a dozen complaints so far about her behavior. It requires approval-style consensus of all collective leads present at an event to remove someone from camp, since that also removes them from the collective (which won't matter in this case, since Kafka hasn't been invited to the collective). But that's our process, and it's worked well so far. Every time we have to do it sets or reinforces a precedent, so we want to make sure that's a precedent we want to establish and maintain.
   11:30am: Catching up with Mark in the kitchen.
   11:45am: Cook a burrito, setting the goal of eating more than 1,000 calories today. I haven't felt safe in the common areas with Kafka around, so haven't been eating or filling ice water as frequently as I really should be to stay safe out here.
   noon: Burrito lunch and catching up on family stuff with Kendra. Still waiting for the rest of the collective leads (Daniel, Michael, David, Dano, and Ashley) to arrive. I bring everyone up to speed on why we need to meet:
   
      * I need to tell Kafka to make other arrangements for a home on playa, that we have no room for people who refuse to pull their own weight, take care of their own needs, or handle their share of camp duties.
      * She has a history of violence towards me, has assaulted me physically (especially when I tell her no) and sexually in the past, and has recently shouted at Kendra more than once. I feel materially unsafe around her, and can't participate in our camp events if she's around.
      * She's extensively lied to and manipulated me and my friends to get a ride out here. 
      * She hasn't pulled any of her own weight or her share of the camp's weight, despite many people expressing these expectations to her. This is and will continue to be a drain on our physical resources while excluding me from them. 
      * She hasn't bonded with anyone in camp. This predicts that she also won't integrate during camp events and will further drain our social resources while excluding me from them.
      * The last time we had to remove someone with violent tendencies, it didn't go so well. How can we do this more effectively? How do we word a no-freeloader policy? Do we want such a policy, or is this a one-off?
   
   12:15pm: Kafka shows up with some Russian friends of hers while I'm still orienting people. Their lead tells me she's moving to staying with them at the 9:00 BRC post office. I tell her we've had serious problems with her in our camp, and say Спасибо Большой for taking Kafka on as her responsibility. Kafka has taken initiative to take care of her needs for the first time since her flight landed in Seattle.
   12:45pm: She's done moving out, near as we can tell. I get her passport from my car (Michael accompanies me, just in case), write my goodbye note to her, share a kiss with Kendra, and tuck the note in Kafka's passport that I hand to Michael to give her:
   
      I can't welcome you in my life any longer. Your lies to me, my friends and
      family, and your relatives have destroyed my trust in you, and I need your
      exploitation and abuse of me and my family to stop.
   
      We've arranged for you to return to Seattle on the camp bus. After exodus, 
      please empty our joint bank account and use those funds to get yourself to 
      Portland in time for your flight back out of this country. You'll need to 
      arrange a time with Kendra to collect your things from her and my home. And
      you'll need to arrange places to stay in Seattle and Portland on the way. 
   
      Don't return to my camp, and don't contact me again.
      Safe travels, and goodbye.
   
   1:00pm: Leaving for ban mi and bubble tea with Kendra and Ryan. Need to get out of camp and clear my head a bit.
   
      Inline image 5
      Fig 9: Ryan in front of the art bus sound stage before the storm
   
   1:45pm: Finally got to the head of the line for food, and they run out ten people in front of us. Kendra does score us some bubble tea, though. So we head over to Mark and Ty's Shitshow.
   2:00pm: We arrive and I head straight to Mark, my and Kendra's playa dad. Long hugs and eye contact with Mark. Everything is going to be okay. Hugs with Ty as well, The One Who Can Fix Anything.
   2:45pm: Mark shows me some archetype cards. The one I most closely align with is "Children of the divine".
   
      As a child of age 11 through 14, the first four foreign languages I learned
      were Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. The home I grew up in is heavily
      religious and I'd already read through the bible (and the apocrypha, those
      books left out of the bible, considered to be of divine inspiration but not 
      of divine authorship) a few times in different English translations. Next, I 
      set out to read the holy texts of many other major world religions in their 
      original languages as well. By the time I got to the next languages on my 
      list (Arabic, Icelandic, & Tibetan), puberty was starting, and things got 
      too weird for me to keep stuffing dead languages into my brain-holes.
   
      At age 18, as soon as it was legal, I received three ministers licenses from
      two congregations--one Southern Baptist, one Church of Christ. I'd already 
      been teaching biblical languages at one church for a few years. Nearly
      everyone in my family is either a minister or married to one. I followed
      step, and worked as a church choir director from age 18 until age 22. When I
      came out, they invited me to resign, which I did. I took solace in the 
      Buddhist path a few years later, which is still my home. 
   
   2:50pm: The card says "Children of the divine have difficulty defending themselves against negative forces", which is completely correct in my case. I rely heavily on others to tell me when someone's lying to or manipulating me. What I hear is what I think is what I say, for better and for worse. This is a pervasive trait of Autism. And expecting others to be this straightforward doesn't always work out well, which is why I can't give dishonest people any space in my life. Dishonesty, manipulation, and sarcasm are nearly impossible for me to recognize or employ. It's just not how I'm wired.
   3:00pm: Mark asks "what is your redemption?". I tell him about my research with Lifeboat.
   
      When I started my career in defense research, I told the hiring manager my
      boundary: I won't create, improve, or maintain any device that harms life.
      And they respected that for my five-year tenure there. A few years ago, I 
      was invited to advise the research of the Lifeboat Foundation, one of
      Kurtzweil's labs. Our job is twofold: 
   
      1) Identify all technology-driven existential threats to our species (hint:
         climate change is by orders of magnitude the most likely candidate), and
      2) Defend against as many of those as we can.
   
      So far, (2) above happens mostly through publications, briefs, and proposals
      to intergovernmental agencies such as United Nations. I advise the foundation
      in eight key areas: artificial intelligence, privacy, transparency, ethics,
      engineering, neuroscience, media, and robotics. But most of my work is in AI,
      specifically computational meta-ethics: getting computers to understand the
      abstract concepts of "right" and "wrong" like we do so Skynet doesn't happen.
   
      * Morality is a culture's construction of right and wrong. 
      * Ethics is the systematic study of moralities.
      * Meta-ethics is the study of how to predict and model ethical behaviors.
      * Human agency is our ability to make and act upon decisions.
      * Intersubjective agency is a groups' ability to make and act upon decisions.
   
      If you construct a meta-ethic around actions that maximize intersubjective
      human agency, there is a 100% alignment with anthropological ethical 
      universals, and full support for the UN Universal Declaration of Human 
      Rights. This will eventually be my third TED talk, third book, or both.
   
   3:15pm: Mark and I amble around in conversation, looking for parallels between this construction of ethics and intercultural constructions of divinities. Stories are the roots of the sacred. Mark offers time and touch on my left arm, and the pain and constriction of the past 48 hours melts away. Back to full function.
   3:30pm: Mark makes me a lettuce, onion, and tomato sandwich on sourdough like only he can, using his own custom genetically designed tomatoes.
   3:37pm: "Love is a tangible flavor" --Kendra
   4:00pm: Cloud cover approaching 90%, and rain is on the horizon.
   4:20pm: Heading back to camp.
   4:35pm: Back at camp, catching Jesse's 90's hip hop set which has turned into a moderately-sized block party. People are drinking, dancing, and the mood is night-and-day different now that Kafka has departed camp this morning. I left my purple tutu at home this year since I decided the two blankets that took up the same amount of space in my bin would probably serve me better than a tutu. Even SK is wearing clothes--a tutu for TuTuTuesday!
   
      Inline image 15
      Fig 10: Ashley and SK's tutus for Tututuesday
   
   4:45pm: Taylor tells me she needs to move her sleeping arrangements to Conception, which can better accommodate her health needs, but will continue to spend the bulk of her time here with us. I nod and request that she not die.
   5:00pm: Block party going strong, even through white-out winds and slight rain.
   5:55pm: A wall of dust, 250 feet tall, comes at us at around 40 MPH. For the first time in half a decade of burns, I grab my goggles and dust mask. The sound stage stays going as the wall hits, but Jack's carport (which is the front-line of winds coming from this direction) partially uproots. Eight of us hanging onto it keep it from blowing away, then Andrea re-drives the rebar that was holding it down. Michael continues making people quesadillas and Daniel keeps the drinks coming.
   6:00pm: Keith Salender's carport next door is picked up and thrown fifty feet on top of a truck, bent badly.
   6:20pm: I find Keith and offer him and Ginny a spot in our camp.
   6:30pm: Jack cooks bacon. I give Taylor half of mine.
   6:40pm: Taylor gets a bacon and gives me half of hers.
   6:52pm: Michael and Daniel safety-check the flamethrowers. I give Michael the key to the system controller that's still in my pocket from last night.
   7:04pm: An F-16 flies overhead, carrying my navigation system. The same one that brought my little brother home safely numerous times. He now flies the stealth bomber and I haven't seen him in seven years. I miss him and hear twice a year from our mother that he and his wife and two kids are well.
   8:00pm: SK takes the stage, playing hardstyle on Synferno. Accumulator pressure on the low side since the BPM is higher than we calculated optimum flow rates for. They don't appear to notice the difference.
   8:15pm: Putting dinner on to boil and catching up with David in the den. Kendra needs to reschedule our temple date, which is okay since David is still up for coming. And there's a thing in my purse I really need to leave behind.
   8:30pm: Dinner, tikka masala.
   8:42pm: Catching up with Randy and Kasia.
   9:05pm: Leaving for the temple with David. It's that time of year again.
   9:20pm: Walking around the temple together once, then finding a seat to talk. Talked through my feelings about the engagement ring I need to leave--the one Kafka gave me in 2010. I'm not that person any longer, nor do or did I want to be. Back then, I couldn't identify or talk about what I want. Raised to be a minister, taking care of everyone else first, it took decades for me to be able to show myself any measure of the compassion I show everyone else. And I used to always let my needs take back-seat to everyone else's. I try not to do that any longer. This ring isn't a thing I want. It's a thing I need to leave behind.
   9:44pm: David talks a bit about the things he needs to leave. We get up, find a good spot in the temple, and use the one pushpin between the two of us to attach the things to the wooden wall. We share everything else, no problem sharing a pushpin, too. We stand there in quiet tears for a few minutes.
   10:00pm: We head back to camp.
   10:10pm: Learn from Jenn Dolan that ESD (our across-the-street neighbors, directly in the path of our sound stage) came over not to ask us to turn it down, but to ask us to stop playing happy hardcore.
   10:30pm: Catching up with David, Travis, and Ryan in the kitchen, sharing the origin stories of our playa names. Mine, linenoise, came from the phone phreaker community in rural Texas in 1994 at age 14. I simply had noisy phone lines, so that's what people called me. And it stuck--as my phreaker handle, radio handle, playa name, and DJ name. At this point, it's just my name. And it's by far the name I've had the longest.
   11:45pm: Introducing Ryan and Ginny, two people who know a great deal about cancer treatments. Ryan recommends we watch "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring again" together once we're back in Seattle.
   
   Wednesday, August 30th, 2017
   
   1:20am: Aditya arrives and shows up in camp! Me and Michael head out to 9:30 and L to pick up him, Jad, and their gear on foot. Michael grabs the ice cart.
   1:40am: We arrive at 9:30 and L, find the RV, unload it, find out the RV is going to 9:30 and C, re-load it, then follow them to 9:30 and C.
   2:05am: Found the RV at 9:15 and C. We unload all gear onto the cart and head home.
   2:15am: We arrive home to catch the middle of Scar's wonderful gabber set. Taylor tells me she didn't need to move since the place where Kafka's tent was is perfect for her (out of the sunlight and lower dust). Introduce her and the folks in the kitchen to Aditya and Jad, show them where the tools and nearest portos are, and pass out hard in my tent.
   9:45am: Woke up to heat, opened vents a little more, and start getting cleaned up and ready for the day.
   10:17am: Ready for the day! Heading out to look for my laptop that SK and Scar were using to play last night.
   10:30am: Breakfast hangouts in the kitchen.
   10:45am: Jenn and Jess are finishing their capture the flag poles behind the bus, and I climb up to the bus to find my laptop left up there. Grab it and head back to my tent.
   11:00am: Breakfast hangouts with David in my tent. He shares some sausage and pesto pizza.
   11:30am: Breakfast hangouts with Taylor in my tent.
   noon: Scar stops by! Give her a Tautology pendant and patch and thank her for her set last night. Wander through the social areas telling people I'm starting electronic repairs in my tent, so bring me any broken blinky things they have that need to be fixed. I look for and can't find Wil and Marie's radios at this point.
   12:30pm: Start on electronics repair, fixing Kendra's broken EL wire crown. Solder joints between the inverter and EL wire itself have come loose. Re-solder them and return the crown to our Kendra.
   1:10pm: An esteemed delegate from Sparkle Donkey village comes by my tent with Megan to complain about the hardcore sets from last night. I tell her that our sound stage is open-access to us and our neighbors, radically inclusive, and told her where to find and how to operate our decibel meter to ensure our DJs aren't playing more loudly than BRC permits. Give her a hug and thank her for stopping by.
   1:30pm: Fixing Kasia's tent lights. There's a pretty clean break in the middle that's been repaired once, but in a manner that never holds up out here. Solderless joints with heat-shrink tubing doesn't withstand playa temperature. I repair it properly and leave it by her tent.
   1:37pm: Listening to Michael's set on our pirate radio station through my handheld HAM radio. Talking Heads.
   1:45pm: Walk around our camp and Dreamscape announcing last call for broken blinky things.
   1:49pm: Fixing Rowan's broken bike lights. Another easy-to-fix clean break.
   1:50pm: Brandon Emerson is here! Give him a hug and point him towards Travis.
   2:07pm: Fixing Scar's EL wire driver. Batteries were half-dead, termination end wasn't terminated (and was exposing high-voltage AC that would shock people to the touch). Fixed termination, replaced batteries, and returned to her.
   2:20pm: Fixing Michael's LED keychain. Battery was half-dead and the contact had lost tension. Retensioned, replaced CR2032 battery, and returned to him on top of the bus as Kazar got setup for his and Joaquin's uplifting trance set. 
   2:30pm: Kazar and Joaquin's set begins! Sound check and give Joaquin his pendant and patch for playing out on our sound stage.
   2:42pm: Fixing Kendra's bike basked lights. Angel-wire like Kasia's, but with a break right at one LED. I bypass that one, re-solder and bring the basket back to Kendra.
   2:50pm: Come out to the social area to find Nathan from Sparkle Donkey getting rudely in Kendra's face about the hardcore sets from last night. I kindly escort him out the back door.
   3:02pm: Done fixing blinky things! Put lunch on to boil.
   3:12pm: Doing the dirty dishes Kafka left for the last time.
   3:30pm: Lunch, tamale and burrito.
   3:40pm: Putting the "just play me techno and tell me I'm pretty" sticker Andrea gave me from Brandon on my laptop. I've been looking for one of these for a long time, ever since I saw one on a flower pot on Orcas Island.
   4:30pm: Travis comes by to warn us of an impending white-out. I zip up my and Kendra's tents and lay down for a nap.
   7:00pm: Woke up, getting ready for family night!
   7:30pm: Walk back from the portos with Taylor and Rowan.
   7:45pm: Wandering around camp, looping people into plans.
   8:25pm: Family night begins!
   8:35pm: A bunch of Aditya's friends stop by. I tell them tonight is a private camp event.
   8:40pm: Jenn Perez stops by. Hugs, then same response.
   8:45pm: Aditya wants to play music. I go turn on the sound stage and Michael goes to turn on the generator.
   9:00pm: Introverting in tent, I really needed the night off and for people to meet their own needs.
   9:30pm: Rejoining the social area, start connecting with David.
   9:35pm: Edward is here and needs to use my laptop. I go get it for him.
   9:40pm: More introverting until people who want me to do things for them go away.
   10:00pm: Spending time with Jesse, Ginny, SK, and Michael. I give Ginny my yoga pants since she's cold.
   
   Thursday, August 30th, 2017
   
   Midnight: Hanging out in Web of Dreams with Ginny, SK, and Jesse, coaxing passersby to "Climb the thing!". SK takes the top-to-bottom tube head first numerous times. Still naked, of course. "As we say in Seattle, Goodbye Forever!" 2am: Got everyone back out of WoD safely. Headed to tent, layered up, passed out. Another cold night.
   9:45am: Woke up to ninety-degree heat in my tent, still wearing my shirt, hoodie, flannel, and vest. First order of business: Clothes off, fans on. Second, pretzel nuggets. I don't know what it is about these peanut butter pretzel nuggets--I never eat them in the default world. I'll buy them, and they'll just sit in the pantry until the next burn. But at Burning Man, they're the first thing I want in my food hole when I wake up.
   10:00am: Ready for the day. Big fire night ahead, wearing my Moonrock shirt.
   10:15am: Taylor's up making bacon for everyone. Breakfast catching up with folks.
   11:45am: Setting up sound stage for Jess to play.
   12:30pm: Jess done playing, putting on La Fraicheur, Christian Loeffler, HVOB, and Luke Mandala sets to play while Kendra and I are at temple.
   1:45pm: Leave for Tripp's memorial with Kendra. He's the one who gave her her play name who died of acute liver failure the week after Critical. Most of her and my playa family (Mark and Ty and clan) will be there. I accompany to be with her and spend time with them.
   2:10pm: Arrive at Cotton Candy Camp on Rod's Road. Find Mark and plant next to him. Met Mead and talked about nerdy things for awhile. I appear to have left notebook in camp, so am taking notes in sharpie on a cotton candy roll.
   2:30pm: Heading to temple with Kendra, Mark, and tribe.
   2:45pm: Arrive at temple with Kendra. Gave her the mala beads I brought to give her when we got here. They're made from the seeds of the bodhi tree, the most sacred tree in Buddhism.
   3:00pm: Tripp's memorial service. Lots of really shitty beer (keystone light, mainly) and singing ("Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me A Mercedes-Benz")
   3:55pm: Nearly out of water, heading home with Kendra. Using purse as a sling for my left arm which isn't working well at all in this heat.
   4:10pm: Alex is here! He got stuck in road closures on the way in due to brush fires. His energy level ("burningmanburningmanburningman!") and ours ("FUCK it's stupid hot and we've been here for a week") couldn't be less in line. I help him settle in and figure out where to put all the food he brought out.
   4:30pm: Relaxing and hydrating in camp. Daniel is back from Hell Station with a propane fill for camp.
   6:10pm: My laptop informs me that my paycheck is about to be deposited. Starting my electronic set, playing downtempo.
   
      DJing electronic music uses a lot of the same skills as being a church choir
      director. Instead of four sections (sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses), I 
      have four decks: A, B, C, and D. I'm choosing pieces of music that work with
      each other tonally and thematically that I like and I think others will like.
      I keep everything in sync and on track, change things about them until they 
      fit what I want to hear. And it brings people together, which is kind of the 
      point of all of this. It hits the same reward centers for me as directing 
      church choirs used to. It works for me.
   
   7:20pm: Daniel brings me his famous White Boy Enchiladas! He goes to turn on the flame effects while Jack makes drinks for everyone.
   7:30pm: Playing mostly dub techno. Pretty much the whole camp is out front, stringing up the fuckpoline.
   7:40pm: Switching to uptempo techno as Daniel turns on the flamethrowers and I sync them.
   9:00pm: Fire dancing: Allison, Aislinn, and Travis take turns on the floor.
   10:05pm: Jack brings me water! Also mentions that he really enjoys all of this. That gives me a huge smile.
   11:10pm: Legs giving out, so I finish up the set and go lay down for a few minutes before my and Kendra's and Ryan's deep playa date to the Blind Tiger.
   11:30pm: Allison finds me and tells me she's joining! Start getting ready for the night.
   11:50pm: Leaving camp with Kendra, Ryan, Allison, and Jack, who decided to join at the last minute! Waypoints: Man Base, Tree of Tenere, Portos, Temple of Gravity, Blind Tiger, Flower Tower, sleep. It's Kendra's first night to leave camp for anywhere other than gate or the portos, so we make sure we have everything we need to hit the big stuff.
   
   Friday, September 1st
   
   12:15pm: Arrive at man base, now open. We check out the art installations scattered around the innermost circle around the man. The first one reminds me strongly of something Esse Quam Videri would do.
   12:50pm: "I like having a small man this year. It's human-scale, like Portland!" --Jack
   1:03am: We stop by Starfield, Lane's installation that Dano and Ashley are working on. I like the new frame technique and mechanism for keeping the light rails safe from detachment.
   1:06am: The phoenix, which Allison tells me is burning in the morning. It has a skeleton that should stand after the burn.
   1:13am: Tree of Tenere, fully functioning. Wow.
   
      Inline image 9
      Fig 11: Tree of Tenere up close
   
   1:40am: Temple of Gravity, warming up. Help Ryan climb up one of the stones.
   1:52am: Blind Tiger. We set to decoding the puzzle. And shivering.
   2:08am: Solved the puzzle in sixteen minutes. Shitty drinks and buttons and dry popcorn received.
   2:32am: En route to Flower Tower, we pass Robot Heart, the second best mobile sound system on playa. Still haven't found Mayan Warrior this year, the only art car who's sound stack is both louder and more precise.
   2:34am: Flower tower. Search in vain for the mechanism that makes its poofer go off. Met Kendra's friends from gate, gave them bearings to Temple of Gravity.
   2:50am: Heading home because it's REALLY cold again.
   3:15am: Home. Lost Jack on Esplanade, but caught up with Allison. Next three things on the agenda: Water, Whisky, Warm. In that order. Blew through the top half of my bottle of Whiskey dealing with Kafka. The second half is going much more slowly.
   3:20am: Passed out.
   noon: Woke up, porto trip, electrolytes, sunscreening
   12:45am: Putting burritos on to boil for me and Jack. He's preparing to bartend for my classical set, wearing one of our friend Matthew's old t-shirts.
   1:40pm: Finished 1.5 liters each of water and electrolytes. Cooling off before I'll need to be standing on top of the sound stage for 5+ hours.
   2:00pm: Aislinn refills my peanut butter pretzel nuggets!
   2:15pm: Starting my classical set. Aditya cleaned my mixer board for me!
   
      Inline image 13
      Fig 12: Aditya!
   
   2:20pm: Alex comes by to bring me a popsicle!
   2:25pm: Mark comes by to bring me a coconut water. Not asking for any of this, people are just showing they care, near as I can tell. I love this tribe.
   3:00pm: Allison checks on my. Half of camp is on WoD or hanging out on top of the bus.
   4:00pm: Petr recommends I check out the Tin Hat Quartet as I play "Improvisation for Coughs and a Cellphone" by Nils Frahm.
   5:00pm: Playing a brief selection from Lubomyr Melnyk's abandoned nuclear reactor recital earlier this year. You're not going to publicly hear this anywhere else in the world.
   
      A few months ago, a friend of mine from various local art collectives and one
      of the Tautology leads texted me to show up at a particular nuclear facility
      at noon, four hours south of us. She asked me to bring microphones and as
      many speakers as I could. So, of course I did.
   
      I arrived to find a grand piano sitting square in the middle of an abandoned
      nuclear cooling tower, surrounded by an array of high-grade recording gear
      and a gaggle of sound techs feverishly metering the environment and adjusting
      their gear. And half an hour late, my friend arrives with my favorite living
      classical musician, Lubomyr Melnyk, casually chatting with her in the 
      passenger seat. Probably in Ukrainian. He's also an autistic savant.
   
      He gets out, introduces himself and gets to know the seven of us invited to
      be in the audience, then sits down at the keys, briefly sound checked, then
      for the next 45 minutes produces one of the most beautiful things I've ever
      witnessed in my life. I was in tears the entire time. I grabbed a field
      recording, naturally, complete with coughs and traffic noise.
   
      Then he stood up, we packed the piano and gear back onto the trucks. We were 
      back out in minutes, leaving no trace.
   
   6:00pm: Shutting down the set after only four hours of the 5.5 planned since my gear is all overheating and skipping. Tried fanning an $800 piece of equipment (my mixer) with a $500 piece of equipment (my tablet). This didn't appear to actually help cool anything off.
   6:12pm: Kendra puts dinner on to boil. Saag and Chicken Tikka Masala. I have never eaten this well at the burn in my life. This year, I gave Kendra enough money to cover food costs for me. That was a Good Life Choice. Sig Pikul stops by to say hello!
   6:30pm: Eating dinner in the common area. Scott stops by to copy his music to my laptop since his DJ equipment has died the playa death.
   7:10pm: Cleaning up and getting ready for adventure night: changing batteries, tidying tent, making the bed and folding in a stack on my desk all of the layers I'll need to add one by one as the night gets colder. And weirder.
   8:00pm: For the first time since we got here, everyone in camp is in the same place at the same time, except for Jad who had to leave the day after he arrived because of work expectations.
   8:15pm: Adventure night begins!
   8:30pm: Talking biochemistry with Andrea, Andrew, Alex, and Ginny.
   9:45pm: Sound checked for Scott, our breakbeat DJ from London on our sound stage. His music finished importing on my laptop just under an hour ago.
   10:00pm: Head to get ramen at The Dusty Gaijin (formerly The Dustly Noodle). This year, I get the shoyu bowl, which I prefer to the miso bowl I had there last year. There are four soup camps within a one-block radius of us this year, so we have to be specific when making plans on where to meet up.
   10:45pm: At the portos for a different task that rhymes with "soup". Someone with a megaphone the next porto over is announcing the details of his restroom break. "Pee with me, pee with me, everyone on playa is peeing with me."
   11:00pm: Stopped by to gift Scott with a bottle of Jameson (which was itself gifted from Ryan as he and Kendra headed out on their deep playa date) as a thank you for playing so much on our stage. I think that was one of our better musical decisions. Go back to spending time with Ginny, Travis, David, Rowan, Scar, and SK in the camp social area.
   
   Saturday, September 2nd, 2017
   
   1:00am: Scott heads home and Aditya takes the sound stage!
   1:15am: I get up to turn Aditya up. Last year, he camped in our overflow area next to Jenn and Jess and Chris and Ashley. We adopted him when he came over playing really good afro-beat music on a small boom box and we offered to help him make it louder by plugging him into our sound stage. And he let us use his boom box as a monitor for the DJ booth since we forgot to pack monitors last year. Just under a year later, we're still turning him up. Solid. He reminds me of his symphony performance tomorrow at Center Camp. I tell him that if I'm awake, I'll be there. He says that's a good answer.
   2:00am: Curled up in bed under the covers listening to the sounds of Burning Man coming from every direction.
   2:30am: Fell asleep.
   9:30am: Woke up in all my layers and under a sleeping bag in a ninety degree tent. Rectified the situation immediately with naked and fans and water and peanut butter pretzel nuggets.
   10:00am: Learn from Michael that the generator was spewing oil last night. Not a good sign, but not enough for us to retire it in favor of the less roadworthy backup sound stage generator we also brought.
   10:15am: I'm awake, and I told Aditya "if I'm awake in time, I'll head to his symphony performance", so I head to his symphony performance at Center Camp.
   10:30am: At center camp, it's announced that the symphony has moved to Frozen Oasis at 8:15 and C (the same place they played last year, across the street from us). They were double-booked with some tribal speakers from Standing Rock, so the symphony decided to offer to move. I run into Wil and Marie and move to mosey in that direction.
   10:36am: I've got half an hour to burn, so I stop by a museum on the way to the symphony. I love that this sort of thing happens in Black Rock City. The Mansonian Museum has a large timeline of The Man builds at Burning Man with photos, statistics, and descriptions of each. Very nicely done.
   10:55am: Arrive at the Playa Pops symphony performance. Say hi to Aditya and meet up with Wil and Marie as well. Find a place to sit down near the back.
   11:00am: They open with Also Sprach Zarathustra, then introductions of the crew that organizes this crew.
   11:45am: Nicely done performance of the Egmont Overture, Beethoven's "fuck you" to Napoleon. My pen finally completely dies, so I switch to sharpie in my notebook.
   12:00pm: Symphony wraps up with "Happy Birthday" being played on kazoos thrown out to the audience, then I head back to camp.
   12:15pm: Lunch of improvisationally bacon-fried tamales and sriracha. Like Christ Intended (tm). Grace is here, and reports having injured herself on the ice truck. Jack says he has enough crew for tear-down, though.
   12:30pm: Ginny, Allison, and I brainstorm ideas on how to deal with the influx of "Flower people", the weekenders who bring tribal feather headdresses to playa and MOOP up the place with feathers. Our invention includes flamethrowers.
   12:45pm: Foot care. Still no chemical burns, much to my surprise, since it consistently feels like there's more playa dust inside my boots than outside them.
   1:30pm: Laying down to rest through the peak of the afternoon heat. 
   5:00pm: Woke up from strange dreams of being in Tibet. Wondering what I was eating in the dream and who was with me in the vans on the way to the monastery. And why I was wearing that strange dress.
   6:00pm: Dinner, gumbo and gnocci. A visitor friend of Aditya's comments on our radios. I tell him about March Hare, my communications collective that also uses these to run comms and maps for large political demonstrations. I point him to the archive of resources we maintain on how to build a free society of free people:
   
      http://infoshop.io/
   
   6:20pm: Officially retiring my Zebra F-701 pen. It was a good pen that lasted many yeas on playa and off. No longer taking notes in sharpie. Ryan gave me his PaperMate Profile 1.4b, and Wil stops by shortly after to give me a pen that he found in the console of his car.
   6:30pm: Wil suggests that my dream means I need to go to Tibet. I agree. I've been meaning to take a pilgrimage to Lhasa for many years.
   7:00pm: Herding cats to get everyone ready to go to the man burn by 7:30pm.
   7:15pm: Daniel and Aditya are wearing adorably coordinated coveralls and ties.
   7:30pm: Leaving for the man burn with Mark, Rachel, Petr, Kendra, Scar, Dano, Ashley, Lia, Andrea, Daniel, and David.
   8:00pm: Lock our bikes behind the art cars and find a spot to sit down near Seattle's conclave at the 2:00 side of the perimeter. Run into Devananda and Amy Krog. Write down to make plans with Amy once we're back in Seattle and settled in for the winter.
   8:15pm: Waiting for conclave to begin. I lean up against David, Kendra's leaning on Ryan, and Ashley's leaning on Dano. All is right with the world. Say hello to Travis and Brandon who turn to see us in the audience. Notice Jack and Michael made it out and found our group!
   9:02pm: The arms of The Man raise into position.
   9:13pm: Conclave performance begins! Folks I notice in our conclave: Allison, Aislinn, Travis, Brandon, Sean, Megan, and Kat. 
   9:43pm: The Man lights on fire.
   9:50pm: The Man falls.
   10:10pm: Kendra gets up to go take down WoD. I tell folks we're heading out and go to unlock bikes. Around half of those of us present get up to follow.
   10:17pm: Headed back to camp with Petr, Rachel, and Scar.
   10:27pm: Back at camp, cleaning up and changing in tent. Some folks starting to trickle back from the man burn.
   10:30pm: Fell asleep while changing out of my day clothes. I manage to get one work glove on (to go help take down WoD) before passing out.

   Sunday, September 3rd, 2017
   
   7:50am: Woke up with one glove on and one still on my bed, fully rested and ready for pack-out and temple burn. Start cleaning, sorting, and packing up personal gear.
   7:52am: Queued an email to send to Aunt Sherri about travel plans and how they might need to shift around a bit. 
   
      Aunt Sherri is one of the four "rainbow sheep" in my family: those of us who
      have been kicked out of my group of relatives for not being conservative
      enough. Most often, it happens because one of us came out as LGBT. Sherri was
      unique--she was kicked out for marrying a black man. She and uncle Craig live
      together in Sacramento, and I swing by to see them on the way home from 
      Burning Man each year. The other Rainbow Sheep are me, my cousin Alexa, 
      and my twin sister Danica.
   
      Sherri's husband Craig is a kind and wonderful man who I love getting to 
      spend time catching up with every year. As a kidney transplant recipient, 
      however, he's immunocompromised pretty much 24/7. This means that if anyone
      in camp was sick that year, we have to skip seeing Craig and focus on
      catching up with Sherri at a restaurant or some such. The risks are too high, 
      since even a common cold could hospitalize him for weeks or risk his life.
      I tell her me and Taylor are well, but a cold has been going around camp. The
      email queues to send as soon as I've got bandwidth to my tablet again.
   
      My group of relatives is more accepting these days--my niece came out as 
      lesbian late last year, and was met with a much more accepting response from 
      my mother. They've come a long way to be more accommodating to their LGBT 
      roots. The mega-church at which my stepdad is a minister even built an LGBT 
      center a few years ago for inclusion rather than the conversion therapy I was 
      subjected to as a kid. There are still many bigots among my relatives, but
      no open bigotry remaining in my mom's or sister's homes.
   
   7:55am: Sorting everything into three piles at opposite ends of my tent:
      * Stuff going on the truck (just my two bins),
      * Stuff going in my car (anything I'll need at Imagine next weekend), and   
      * Stuff going in the bus (i.e. overflow).
   9:08am: Michael plays the same "morning train" loop on our sound stage that Erik VanBuren used to terrorize Critical Northwest. This kicks off a debilitating full-symptom panic attack. I remember climbing up the bus and telling him to turn it off, which he did. Quickly. I tell him I'd rather see my sound gear destroyed rather than ever get used as a weapon again.
   9:15am: Kendra finds me mid-panic attack in my tent, now only the second person ever (to my knowledge) to see me go through one of these things up close and personal. She does all the right things: asking before touching, listening, directing traffic away from me, and asking "where are you" rather than how things are going. Opening my eyes, I'm surrounded by a forest back at Critical Northwest.
   
      Critical is the Seattle burner community's regional festival. This year, our 
      group brought out and supported seven different art installations, many of 
      which I had a role in. I arrived Wednesday afternoon and set my things up in
      Softlandia, a group of close friends of mine who invited me to camp with them 
      before David announced he was leading a camp for Tautology there that year.
   
      At Critical this year, I spend all of my time building or repairing art, 
      unsuccessfully trying to find friends of mine (Potluck are the only folks I
      could consistently find), eating, or sleeping. It was an uncomfortable, loud,
      lonely experience. None of my team was able to make it to integration testing 
      for my installation (since they were in too deep with another installation
      that was four days behind schedule), so I ended up needing to cancel my
      installation's only performance. I spent one last night there on Friday, 
      trying fruitlessly to find any of the people I share emotional support with. 
   
      After that didn't pan out into any actual support, early on Saturday morning
      I sleeplessly packed up all of my gear, took two hours to haul it back to the 
      bus, wrote "Seattle" in sharpie on a cardboard box lid, and hitchhiked home. 
      I got a ride back with a friend of mine who was on her way to work. That 
      meant I got to see Flitter on a last-minute trip to Seattle for her, though, 
      which brought things back to good.
   
      During my pack-out, a 24-bar loop of "morning train" played loudly from 
      Erik VanBuren's triceratops art car to make sure nobody got any rest. 
      Critical defends this kind of weaponized sound as "radical expression". 
      This was the fifth Critical I've been to, the second one that's left some 
      kind of trauma scar, and the fifth Critical I've left in tears. I would very
      much like to not be there again during pack-out at Burning Man right now.
   
   10:30am: I notice Michael is taking a look at the flat tire on my car that I can't find the equipment to replace. I have a fully inflated spare tire in my trunk (I checked the pressure before leaving Seattle), but the key to my lug nuts is nowhere to be found.
   11:00am: PTSD flashbacks stop, and I notice that I'm now having no trouble being present in camp in Black Rock City again. I tell the two people acting as our unofficial camp medics (Kendra and Allison). I get the last of my personal gear tetrised into my car, loaded onto the bus, and moved to the staging area for truck load.
   11:30am: Aditya gives me a watermelon beer. I accept, thinking this is perhaps the only time I'd even consider drinking something like that. It was super weird.
   11:35am: I found the missing lugnut adapter that fell out of my bag of car-fixing stuff at some point and was just hanging out in the front corner of my trunk. A concerted effort by Andrea, Jack, Michael, and I to replace my tire pans out into an actually replaced tire.
   11:45am: Alex cooks steak for everyone. Neighbors also bring over a huge plate of steak and bacon. I inhale a few pieces before I can even find the sriracha.
   noon: People taking down side shade walls shade fill my trunk (and my clean exodus jacket) with a thick layer of dust before I can get back to close it.
   12:45pm: Most everyone's gear is packed and staged for load other than the people who are staying past temple burn. Temperature appears to have already crossed 100 degrees, so I head to the bus to recover from the panic attack and keep cool until the sun is closer to setting.
   1:30pm: Heat starts affecting my nerves. Arm and leg constriction starting to set in. I down some ice water and put in earplugs. When things are this loud and bright with shade starting to come down, I need at least one of my primary senses to work well.
   2:30pm: Taylor stops by the bus to check on me and bring me water. The heat has already made sure I'm barely able to walk again. Oof. I go back to resting and trying to stay cool.
   3:30pm: David stops by the bus to check on me. Helps work through all the things: panic attack-related stressors, heat-driven ascending paralysis, emotional matters with Kafka, and how perpetually impressed I am with our team. He offers some of his food, refills my ice water for me, and gets the last of the unopened windows on the bus to open for ventilation.
   4:00pm: Petr and Rachel stop by the bus to tell me they're heading out. I manage to stand long enough for goodbye hugs. 
   4:30pm: Marie stops by and brings me ice.
   5:30pm: Sun starting to set, temperature starting to drop. Manage to stand up for a full five minutes before falling back down again.
   5:45pm: Andrea stops by and brings another round of ice water. Tells me there's not much to do to help with pack-out that can be done not in direct sunlight. And that Kendra is having back spasms.
   6:00pm: Need to use the portos now exceeds the need to avoid the pain of walking. Start on the trek to the end of the block to use the restroom.
   6:22pm: Back from the portos. Goodbye hugs and love with Ginny from Dreamscape on the walk back. Find a spot in the remaining Tautology shade to rest and connect with the people who're leaving before temple burn. We decide there are enough of us in camp who're mobility-restricted that we're going to watch temple burn from the top of the bus rather than walking out there and back.
   7:00pm: Evapotron officially retired from service, having actually functioned all week! Hooray Andrea! She build the first evapotron we've ever used that's actually worked.
   7:15pm: Aditya gifts me with some prayer flags and a dress he brought for me from Nigeria!
   7:20pm: Truck is loaded and closed!
   7:25pm: I apologize to Michael for my outburst this morning. We hug and work out how to better respect each others' needs.
   7:35pm: On top of the bus to watch temple burn with Mark, Travis, Taylor, Aislinn, David, Michael, Allison, Daniel, Alex, Lia, Andrea, Kendra, Ginny, Ryan, and Jesse.
   8:04pm: The temple catches fire, the flames soon reaching to what appears to be a quarter-mile height. I liked the design of this year's temple. Simple enough to be built in a few days (it basically stacked like Lincoln Logs) and open on time, and geometrically contoured enough to make an awesome fire at the end of the week.

      Fig 14: The Temple Burn
   
   8:36pm: The temple falls.
   9:00pm: Final goodbye hugs with everyone still in camp.
   9:12pm: Exodus begins. Leaving Tautology's camp in my Volkswagen Jetta, filled with me (driving), Taylor in the passenger seat, and Kendra and Ryan setting in in the back seat.
   9:37pm: Stopping by to donate a bottle of Jameson to DPW on our way out.
   10:15pm: Wow, this is the worst we've ever seen Gate Road. The series of potholes are around 4-6 inches deep and wide, and run for miles. Three of us in my car have back problems that aren't getting any better.
   10:47pm: Arrive at the point where traffic is completely stopped, at the 3.5-miles-from-pavement marker.
   11:26pm: Pulsing, we move up to just past the 0.5 mile marker.
   
   Monday, August 4th, 2017
   
   12:05am: We've moved up enough to be able to see Nevada route 34, which is packed bumper-to-bumper and stopped from what we soon learn is a wreck in Gerlach. We park, get out, stretch, and I put my earplugs in to lay down to rest for a bit, creatively curled up in the driver's seat. One of the upsides to all of my genetic disorders is Ehlers-Danlos type III (hypermobility). My body doesn't produce much collagen, which makes me super flexible (and makes my joints come out of socket all the time). Much like a cat, I can sleep in just about any position. It takes some time to pop everything back into joint once I wake up, but it's generally possible for me to catch a few minutes of sleep pretty much anywhere. It's really nice during Exodus.
   1:34am: Traffic is moving again.
   1:52am: We hit pavement. Exodus time, BRC side: 4 hours, 40 minutes.
   4:18am: Civilization! We stop for gas in Sparks, Nevada. Taylor breaks up a fight in the gas station that we quickly learned was also a casino and brothel.
   4:50am: Arrive at "Little Nugget diner", which appears to be the only diner that's not a Denny's that's open in Reno at this hour. They're only serving burgers, so we turn heel and head to the Denny's by the airport.
   5:15am: Arrive at the Denny's. One of their patrons is loudly going off about the "desert pagan sex party" towards some other dusty diners. I didn't see any pagan sex parties at the burn this year, but did enjoy plenty of art, museums, friends, and a symphony performance. Nothing against pagan sex parties, though. I'm sure those are all kinds of fun.
   5:20am: I order breakfast (Super Spicy Scramble and iced tea) while Kendra is in the restroom cleaning her hands and feet in the sink. I learn from Ryan that the half of our camp who stayed at the man burn after we left saw a man run into the fire, dodging all of the sandmen, and forging head-first into the man base which was still engulfed in flame. We learn from the news that that man has died of complications from those injuries. Wow. So that's why there was nobody around to help take down WoD that night. Everyone who saw the suicide was (rightly) in self-care mode instead. All of Seattle's conclave and most of the Seattle camps (there at the 2:00 side to support our conclave) were witnesses to the suicide. This takes a while to sink in.
   6:02am: Dropping Kendra and Ryan off at the airport. Goodbye hugs, kisses, and loves. Airport security guard gets huffy when telling me to move my car while I'm trying to confirm plans with Aunt Sherri over text message. I move 100 feet or so down the road and hit the hazards again to go back to texting. He follows in a huff. As he gets close again, I move another 100 or so feet down. This cycle repeats until I get the last of my messages out and drive off with Taylor as the security guard shakes his fist.
   8:00am: No longer able to safely operate a motor vehicle, I hand Taylor the keys. She takes us the last hour in to Sacramento. She also confirms that her friend in Sacramento welcomes us coming by to shower and do laundry.
   9:05am: Breakfast with Aunt Sherri at the Fox and Goose, like usual. It's noisy enough in here that I have to read lips and Taylor has to take a break outside after around 20 minutes.
   10:15am: Heading to Taylor's friend's house in Sacramento. His name is Matt and they know each other from Magic: The Gathering tournaments of days past and
   10:35am: SHOWER.
   11:30am: Ate a bite of the scramble Matt made, then get laundry started before heading out to do post-playa errands.
   11:50am: At the car wash. Power-wash all the dust off, then wax and rain-x the car.
   12:10am: Conversation with Random Man (RM) from car wash:
      RM: Did you just come back from that big hippie party?
      me: Yes, we just got back a few hours ago!
      RM: Did you see that guy kill himself?
      me: ... umm, yeah, half of my camp and many of my friends saw it happen.
      RM: Was he drunk?
      me: ... I don't know. We didn't know him. Sorry. Have a nice day.
   12:15pm: Sitting in tears that half of my camp had to end their burn by watching a guy kill himself. Before I notice it, timer on the vacuum runs out before I can get the playa dust out of the floorboards. I'm out of quarters. I head to Aunt Sherri's house.
   12:49pm: At Aunt Sherri's house, picking up the four bags of clothes she set aside for me. I'm much smaller this year than last year, for a variety of reasons, and can barely keep clothes that fit in my closet. I say hello to Uncle Craig through the front door and tell him I'm looking forward to seeing them in December in Seattle.
   1:30pm: After calling four different tire shops, I finally find one that's open on Labor Day and head there. They tell me it'll be $150 to replace both front tires. I thank them and spend the next hour fielding questions about Burning Man and the suicide that's all over the news to the other folks there getting tires replaced. And catching up on typing in my burn log from my notebook into my laptop.
   2:30pm: Tire is replaced. Heading back to Matt's.
   2:45pm: Back at Matt's, their Magic: The Gathering game has just wrapped up. Having been awake for around 36 hours that began with a two-hour panic attack and was intermittently punctuated by a couple naps, I lay down in their guest room with Taylor and am out light a light.
   8:00pm: Awake and rested. Taylor and I head to dinner as our clothes go through the dryer one more time.
   8:15pm: Found a place that's open, "Oscar's Very Mexican Food". Ordered a chili verde burrito, which was not half bad by the standards of suburban strip mall Mexican cuisine. Taylor compliments the photography in the restaurant, which was legit awesome. Taylor is an incredible photographer.
   9:10pm: Full and ready to mosey.
   9:30pm: Back at Matt's house. We re-tetris the car and backpacks, fold clothes and say goodbyes.
   10:10pm: Heading north, destination: Seattle.
   
   Tuesday, September 5th, 2017
   
   4:30am: Napping at a rest stop in Medford, Oregon. Pretty sketch, but we manage to get some rest.
   7:00am: On the road again. Ash fills the air from every side, and visibility is low. This is like driving in rain.
   1:16pm: Confirming with Kendra that Kafka has vacated our home and the coast is clear for me to return. We did laundry in Sacramento ahead of time just in case I needed to go straight to Orcas from Black Rock City. Thankfully, that didn't end up needing to happen.
   1:30pm: Taylor hears that it's actually raining ash in Seattle.
   2:45pm: Dropped Taylor off at her place in Seattle before jumping back into rush-hour traffic between there and Lynnwood.
   4:30pm: Home. Every hour since we left playa on Sunday night for me has been filled with driving, sleeping, driving, eating, driving, or laundry. "Exhausted" doesn't even begin to describe this feeling.
   4:47pm: Car unpacked, Kendra loved.
