      Hi there,

      Like every year at Burning Man, I carried a little black notebook with me everywhere, recording noteworthy happenings. And like years past, once I'm home, I email these notes to everyone mentioned in these notes. Here are those notes! This year was my favorite burn so far, with such a wonderful tribe in the dust:
   
      * Camped with Tautology at 8:15 and C, mountain-side
      * Meaningfully connected with other people and camps in the village
      * DJed roughly 31 hours of music on our sound stage
      * Ran a pirate radio station on 97.1 FM
      * Became romantically single (voluntarily and amicably)
      * Helped bring out a flamethrower for our sound stage
      * Left photos of my dad and uncle in the temple
      * Successfully avoided burnout by delegating roles and tasks
      * Actually figured out how to relax and let go of expectations
      * Supported art, Web of Dreams, that's received high praise from our peers
   
      The board recordings I got of my DJ sets out there this year didn't turn out well at all. Over the coming week, I'll be remixing, remastering, and releasing them. If you want to hear them when they're released, sign up for the mailing list at http://linenoise.io/. I'll ping that with download links once they're up, as usual. :)
   
      This is compared to my previous three burns:
   
      2013: Came out with my long-time friend Jack's camp, Moonrock--while moving from Portland to Seattle--to my first burn. Overwhelmed by default-world changes and unable to reach out to connect, I spent a great deal of this burn alternating between having panic attacks in my tent and crying in deep playa. I met a lot of neat people, though, nearly all of whom I've stayed close to since then--especially so with the Potluck contingent who was camped with us this year, and with many old-school Moonrockers as well. My friend Jenn Dolan from Portland, acting as my fairy ravemother for this event, is largely to thank for the modest amount of my emotional shit I was able to keep together this week. I decided that Black Rock City was a really neat place, but ultimately not my party. I didn't plan on returning.
   
      2014: So, a friend of mine got an art grant and she needs an engineer. I agree to do all of the engineering (power, structural, lighting, etc) for the Silk Road art installation. I camp with Moonrock again (in BRCSC's inaugural year), but spent most of my time with the people from our art project scattered around the playa who'd from this point on become the roots of Tautology. Oh, and I changed gender presentations (queer to female), pronouns (they to she), and started changing sexes (intersex to female). And my closest friend David the Good and I started dating, as I try to figure out whether or how I'm attracted to fellas. And I came out to my very conservative relatives in Texas. Past this point, my father and most of my relatives stopped speaking to me other than on holidays and about deaths. Oh, and I launched a tech startup from my tent. And wrote my second TED talk (to be given 11 days after exodus). And I couldn't walk for two days, due to my MS getting triggered heavily by the heat. Fun times, but overcommitment led quickly to burnout. I decided again not to come out again next year.
   
      2015: So, another friend of mine got an art grant for Inflection, the twisty rope bridge placed by The Man. He needs an engineer and support camp lead, which I agree to do. I build our shade structure, tend to all the spreadsheets and paperwork, gather the tribe, arrive a week early, survey the village, lead camp, build a bridge, burn a bridge, and return home safely. I successfully juggle commitments, nutrition (kind of--I'm still bad at that), companionship needs, and downtime, and have the first burn I actually really liked! Camped on Dirtrave Road with Tautology in Black Rock City Science Center, right next to Potluck (who brought Simon 2.0 out) and Moonrock. 
   
      2016:
   
      Build week
   
      Tuesday 8/23
   
      8:00am: Woke up, hastily finish packing, rush out the door to pick up Rachel. Remember to leave Mollie's Tautology pendant on her doorknob for her. Email her to let her know it's there.
      9:00am: At Rachel's house, getting her stuff loaded into my car to head to the bus.
      10:00am: Made it to Michael and Kendra's house in Lynnwood! Load the last of the stuff onto the bus with them, Steve, and Alexa. Quick statistics:
   1,267 things packed, indexed, and checked
   447 unique kinds of thing packed
   Purposes served by things packed: Art, Building, Clothing, Communication, Energy, Fire, Food, Gifting, Health, Home, Kitchen, Music, Packing, Safety, Shade, Sound, Transportation
   First thing packed: Bag of 10x10 Kodiak canvas tent poles
   Last thing packed: 3/8" propane line adapter for the flame thrower on the back of the bus.
   Asthma inhalers packed: 5
   Books brought this year: Beyond the Utopian Ideal (Douglas, recommended by Hope), Letters to a Young Poet (Rilke), The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (Kundera, because he's one of my favorite authors), The Prophet (Gibran)
   Watts of amplified sound we're allowed to bring, according to placement: 300
   Watts of amplified sound we're bringing: 21,000. This isn't our largest sound stage by a long shot, but is the largest one we're comfortable dragging out into a desert of corrosive dust and relentless heat.
         Here's the full packing lists for 2016 and each previous burn for me
   
      12:00pm: Heading to Black Rock City, Nevada on Michael Black's converted Seattle metro bus. This is a special city bus with a dance floor welded to the roof. A bunch of bikes, poles, tarps, and bolts of shade cloth are ratchet-strapped to the top. The ratchet strap ends wave gently in the breeze.
      12:30pm: Stopping by Fred Meyer for last-minute food and drinks.
      1:30pm: Posted BRC camp plans to Facebook:
   
         A tautology is a statement that's true in all possible interpretations. It's 
         a form of mathematical truth. The symbol for this, which is on our pendants 
         again this year, can be read as "always equals[0]." You know, if you're into 
         pronouncing math. Tautology Arts Collective is a group of mathematicians, 
         scientists, engineers, designers, makers, accomplices, and co-conspirators 
         who make art and music together. We're scattered around the globe but 
         clustered strongly in Seattle.
   
         We'll be together again at our home in Black Rock City, Nevada from Thursday 
         8/25 through Monday, 9/5. We're in the Black Rock City Science Center again 
         at 8:15 and C, on the man side of the road. Web of Dreams is in our camp, as
         well as a generous sound system, an incredible DJ lineup, an Internet relay, 
         massive shade structure, two chill spaces, a bar, and around thirty 
         tautologists!
   
         See you in the dust! )'(
   
         [0] Andrew Homan and Alice Vidrine corrected this part of my post: 
         "satisfies" or "results in" are probably better ways to pronounce the 
         Tautology symbol [1] in a sentence.

      2:00pm: Stapling the last of the Tautology song books--The Book of Songs for Singing From. Yes, we have a song about fractals. And the Star Trek theme song. And that one song from Portal. And that one song that Jenn Dolan and I learned at the short-lived Weekly Medieval Georgian Singing Night down in Portland that I frequently forget the second verse to.

      3:00pm: Asleep on the bus
      4:30pm: Awake on the bus
      5:12pm: We have an electrical problem on the bus. The new alternator is running, but the battery isn't charging. Trying to track down a commercial truck mechanic somewhere close-by. We start stopping at every truck stop we pass. I dig out my multimeter and pour through the electrical diagrams of the bus but am unable to trace through so many wires that've been cut.
      6:30pm: Continuing our tour of gas stations of Central Washington. We decide we should make a coffee table book.
      7:30pm: Michael manages to track down a mechanic. He is eating a burrito and estimates he'll finish his burrito in fifteen minutes.
      7:54pm: Mechanic finishes his burrito and begins looking at our electrical systems.
      8:10pm: Mechanic gives up; electrical now acting mostly fine. His diagnosis: "There's just something about these busses, they got all these special systems on 'em."
      8:12 24-volt circuit undervolt again. We suspect the load from the inverter is causing problems and unplug it. The problem goes away. I eat the second half of my sandwich while the alternator cools off.
      9:07: Inbox zero. Last email responded to: a warm, personal thread between me and Jack about the burn this year.
      9:30: Michael accidentally dumps sand from the reservoirs on the bus while Rachel and I compare notes on our southern upbringings.
   
      Wednesday 8/24
   
      1:30am: Head to sleep in the bed in the back of the bus
      5:30am: Woken briefly by Kendra crawling over me, saying "I'm in your personal space to grab a towel." Half-awake, I mutter back "mmmmm, I like that."
      6:15am: We appear to be at Summer Lake hot springs. I head to the pool with Steve, Rachel, and Alexa--Michael and Kendra have already headed there and back again.
      6:45am: Done soaking, back to the bus to sleep for a bit. 
      7:00: Rachel's phone alarm goes off. "Cat litter glitter greek yoghurt."
      7:30am: There isn't any horizontal space left on the bus, so I lay some blankets down on the pavement between the bus and the truck and promptly pass out again.
      11:00am: Woke up to the sunlight, Kendra starts setting up to make everyone breakfast while Alexa plays us a video from Papa Bear (the Tokyo Sektor placer) of torrential rain at Will Call. Sometimes the Black Rock Desert likes to reminisce about its glory days as Lake Lahontan. But not for very long. 
      12:00pm: Breakfast burritos from Kendra! Met a German-Turkish woman named Oza who takes solace on our bus while running from a bee. She, Alex, and I depart as soon as the bee is gone to explore the hot springs a bit.
      12:45pm: There are shops, coffee, showers, and pools. Alexa picks up a green full-length knit coat that Kendra immediately asks to borrow eventually. And wants to improve.
      12:55pm: Kendra is knitting a onesie out of a knit blanket. Because Kendra.
      1:30pm: Back on the bus, mostly ready to go. Reading The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Milan Kundera since I can't find that copy of the one Hope recommended. And because Kundera.
      2:45pm: On our way out of the hot springs! I quickly fall back asleep on the bus.
      4:00pm: We're now in Lakeside at the Safeway. I run inside to pick up better hot chocolate than the stuff I packed as well as coffee and snacky things.
      4:15pm: The entire town of Lakeside loses power. I'm in line to check out with a handful of coffee and such, surrounded by the relentless beeps of a small army of battery backups by the checkouts. Eyeing the cabinet of liquor that they probably can't sell us now.
      4:20pm: Safeway is back up on a generator. I check out, pack up, and head back to the bus. The rest of the town appears not to be so well-prepared for blackouts.
      5:00pm: Finally find a place that can sell us gasoline for the bus.
      5:45pm: Fueling complete. Rachel, Kendra, Alex and I compare notes on trauma and good ways to survive it. I send them my notes on the topic and go back to programming radios.
      6:30pm: All nine Tautology radios coded, charged, and tested. Our frequencies this year:
   Tautology (the camp channel), 151.940 MHz, CTCSS at 210.9 Hz
   Dirtrave (the backup channel), 467.6375 MHz, CTCSS at 127.3 Hz
   All FRS, MURS, GMRS, and NOAA frequencies coded and transmit-disabled
      6:34pm: Back to laughter and forgetting.
      7:10pm: Cedarville, at Rabbit Traxx. Picking up whiskey and ice cream. Last stop before Gerlach.
      9:30pm: We reach Gerlach and try to track down directions to Ranger Claymore's house to fill up on water.
      9:45pm: We found her house! And the host isn't long enough to reach from her back yard to the 55-gallon drums on the bus. We decide to fire brigade water to the drums using the smaller 5 and 7-gallon containers we brought.
      10:20pm: Water fill complete. Headed to Black Rock City, Nevada.
      11:10pm: Feet on playa.
      11:30pm: Met John Walter / Woodland, Aurura, and Fractal from True Mirror camp in the Will Call line.
      11:45pm: EA pass tango with Alex. Vehicle Pass left for Joe Breman. Looks like we're going to Burning Man! This is roughly where I think I lost my photo ID.
   
      Thursday, 8/25
   
      12:07am: Picked up three hitchhikers on our way through the gate: Allen, Eric, and Grant from Shady Waffle camp at the 7:30 plaza.
      12:20am: Lined up outside the bus as gate searches us and attaches Early Arrival wristbands that say "TRIGGER WARNING". I promptly turn mine inside out.
      12:30am: We're through the gate and start making our way through the city.
      1:00am: Found the 7:30 keyhole. We drop off our hitchhikers and head to our plot of dust.
      1:10am: Stopped at Ranger Station Tokyo, asking to talk to placement. They tell us to park it and come back after sunrise. That's a first. Usually, they have a placer who'll work at night.
      1:30am: Find where we think BRCSC might be, park, and start drinking.
      2:00am: Climb onto the roof of the bus, unroll my sleeping bag, and feast on a dinner of cold lasagne, oranges, and whiskey. Fall asleep with Alexa on the roof of the bus shortly thereafter.
      9:30am: Woken by sunlight piercing through the blanket over my head. I see SK off in the distance, climb down and run over to say hello and good morning!
      10:00am: SK, Keith Salender, Ginny, Mia, and Hobbes are there unloading Dreamscape's truck. Michael guessed well on where BRCSC would be. Everyone in the village forgot to pack surveying flags. We improvise with rope and cans of beer as placement markers.
      10:45am: Tautology's measuring wheel is now held together with gaffing tape. But it measures and wheels just fine. I get to the process of figuring out where everything goes in our camp. Kendra and Alexa head down to the ARTery to tell them a thing or two about where they can stick their placement markers. Summary:
   First, they refused to place us this year since our art "contains vectors." Note: We are a math and science-based art collective who builds geometric art installations. And we can't "use vectors" in our art, according to the new art team.
   They still sent us a generous handful of EA passes with no placement, which was kind of kind of them.
   They later gave us placement anyhow in inner playa /and then did not inform us/. Web of Dreams is on the art map! This was after we told them not to place us, since our structure /is/ going to be large, climbable, and very geometric. Again.
   A wide variety of placed art this year prominently features geometric patterns. We have a handy list of geometric installations this year to share with them.
   Just over half of the honorarium grants were given to bay area collectives this year. There's a new art support team in The Org who needs to be called out for nepotism.
   Web of Dreams will be built this year within Tautology's camp, not in inner playa as in years past.
   Welcome to Burning Man, the bay-area regional art festival! We're happy to represent Cascadian interests from our home in BRCSC, Tokyo Sektor again this year. 
      11:15am: Whiskey and surveying.
      11:55am: Our bus and truck are where they'll be for the next week or so. Crack a beer and start unloading dusty shadecloth to where it needs to be.
      12:55am: Shade surveyed, laterals and verticals arranged where they need to go. We locate the bin of connectors and break for lunch.
      1:30pm: Lunch break over. Arranging connectors where they need to go.
      2:05pm: With every milestone in setting up our shade structure, I lear Lucretia's voice wafting in the breeze, saying "fuck yer burn". This is going way faster than when she and I did this overnight last year, with solid runs of help from Trevor, Alexa, and David.
      2:10pm: SK is now completely naked, save a necklace and two very strategically placed googly eyes. All is right with the world.
      3:10pm: Shade laterals assembled, top shade cloth bolts in place. Michael makes a sandwich of meat and cheese and gummy worms and fuck it. Nobody remembered to pack mustard. Hernando's Hideaway plays softly in the distance.
      3:40pm: We set up chairs in the shade of the bus while the music in the breeze changes to Tejano, then Mariachi.
      3:55pm: Break time over. Back to bungee ballin' shadecloth to poles!
      4:55pm: All shadecloth arranged, old bungee balls removed from poles and cloth. Mooped a little. Cleaned up.
      5:12pm: Start bungee ballin' the side cloth as we start lifting the laterals off the ground with the vertical segments.
      6:10pm: Shade structure is off the ground and roughly where it needs to be. Start arranging ratchet straps.
      7:30pm: All ratchet straps at tension. Top is level.
      8:00pm: Start unloading truck into the shade structure. Figure out a minor spacing and layout issue regarding the front shade wall. We decide to tilt it 45 degrees forward to that front row of tents can fit.
      8:30pm: Stressed and tired, as the neighboring camp plays some Stevie Ray Vaughan. Hearing SRV reminds me that everything is going to be okay, even if it's not okay right now. Uncle Larry and I are both huge fans of his music.
      8:45pm: All of my stuff is out of the truck. I start setting up my tent.
      9:20pm: Tent is up and things are arranged to be livable for the next week. Alexa stops by. We sit and catch up for awhile, since she came down in the box truck with Steve. Kendra brings by some incredible sake called Mio to share.
      9:45pm: All hands for a good, old fashioned barn-rotatin'. Steve's tent is moved to where it needs to be.
      10:45pm: Flitter stops by! With Kendra! They and Alexa and I hug and cuddle and catch up in my tent.
      11:45pm: Flitter heads back to wherever it is that Burning Man keeps their accountants. I write down to track her address down--I know it's written on my burner map. I check my packing spreadsheet to find where my burner map is. My packing spreadsheet tells me it's on my clipboard with my packing spreadsheet, which is where I promptly find my burner map. I set down the spreadsheets and go to help Michael build the shade structure that sits on top of the bus.
   
      Friday, 8/26
   
      1:00am: Almost done with shade on the bus! We're at the point where there's no more work to be done that requires two people. SK and I scoot back to my tent to catch up.
      1:30am: I learn the origin story of the name "Black Rock City Science Center". Whoa.
      2:00am: I pass out in my tent.
      11:00am: Woke up rested and sore. Breakfast of coffee, pop tarts, and ibuprofen. The usual.
      11:30am: I can't get the chorus of The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins as sung by Leonard Nimoy out of my head. I decide to share this with the rest of camp, or anyone in earshot of my tent. Thanks, Kendra!
      11:45am: My phone rings?!? It's the Seattle Passport Agency telling me they need more forms and signatures and dollars from me in order to renew my passport. I make a note to deal with this as soon as I'm back in the default world, since it might endanger me being camp lead for Potluck's Simon 2.0 build at New Zealand's regional, KiwiBurn, in January. I take note of their expectations, change clothes and finish getting ready for day.
      12:15pm: In my tent, Everything in it's Right Place. Now, Radiohead is in my head. Much better.
      12:45pm: Start hanging side shade panels, and I run into Andrea Pollitt in camp!
      2:15pm: Half of the side shade panels are up. Resting for a few minutes.
      3:00pm: Flitter comes by again to spend time with us and helps attach the side shade panels! Yay flitter! I wish she still lived in Seattle.
      4:00pm: All shade is up, anchored, and ready for camp to move in. I leave the camp spacing and placement map among some chairs in the social area.
      4:20pm: Relaxing with Kendra, Rachel, Flitter, Andrea, and Steve in camp.
      4:45pm: David and Ethan arrive, hootin' and hollerin'! We help them unload and setup the squish pit.
      4:50pm: Rearranged our DJ lineup to accommodate Ethan's plans on playa. Dreamscape now has open decks all evening and night on Tuesday.
      5:30pm: Cascadia flag prominently hung from the shade structure. Cooking, eating, and resting.
      6:00pm: Setting up cuddle popups and inner social area. Cuddles are ready for squish and ravers!
      6:45pm: One of Dreamscape's carports blows away! We and three other neighboring camps rush to their aid and help take it apart. Not completely securing your shade structure turns out to be a great way to meet your neighbors. Theirs was pretty secure, but the wind was stronger this time.
      7:15pm: Unloading Web of Dreams from the camp truck, arraying things more or less in a workable order.
      7:35pm: Truck unloaded.
      8:00pm: Start putting Web of Dreams together next to the shade structure with Kendra, Michael, Rachel, Alexa, David, Steve, and me. We're wondering where Ethan ran off to, since we need him.
      10:20pm: Ethan returns from his side-quest to Spanky's wine bar.
      10:30pm: Web of Dreams scaffolding is complete, nets starting to be arranged.
      11:00pm: Relaxing for the rest of the evening, or until Wes and Mike arrive in a couple of hours.
      11:20pm: Michael and I replace my bike chain.
      11:30pm: David and I fall asleep cuddling in the squish.
   
      Saturday 8/27
   
      8:00am: Woken by the sun.
      8:10am: Good morning hug with Steve on the way back from the portos, in what becomes a pattern for he and I. Steve gives really great hugs.
      8:15am: Met Wes, who has arrived in camp and setup his tent.
      8:45am: Ate breakfast, sunscreened, changed clothes, and ready for the day.
      9:10am: Rachel is back from her other camp (Pink Lightning) and wanting to head back to the greeter station with us to get our WWW guides.
      9:15am: Met Ian from Geisha House across the street, asking around to borrow an arc welder from someone. We didn't bring ours out this year.
      9:30am: Hanging out in camp, reading and talking with Wes, Mike, and other new arrivals. The pile of books on the camp table grows.
      10:30am: We have everyone together who's going to get our WWWs from greeters.
   
         "Turns out people prefer culture to knowledge." -- David the Good
   
      11:10am: At greeter's station, got books and hugs. There are actual greeters there this time this year, though, so we don't rogue our own greeter shift.
      11:20am: Drinking at the Dogfish with Michael, Kendra, Steve, and Alexa.
      11:30am: Met Emily Elizabeth and Greg Goodman (Gandi). Exchange flirtations and email addresses. Emily tells me she's reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. I tell her about Laughter and Forgetting, get her address, and make a note to track down a bowler hat.
   
         "Tune in, turn on, fall off the art car." -- Gandi
   
      1:00pm: Six vodka and power-ades later, biking home drunk with Steve.
      1:26pm: Back home at Tautology, passed out drunk in the squish.
      2:35pm: Woke up, still drunk, to people singing Santeria from The Book of Songs for Singing From.
      3:40pm: Lauren and Daniel arrive!
      4:00pm: Daniel and Jesse arrive!
      4:30pm: Kendra, Wes, and Mike singing songs from their old band. Wes has a bowler hat and is totally willing to let me borrow it when I go find Emily to invite her out to a playa adventure!
      5:00pm: Lots of people leave together to get ice. It's an ice party.
      5:30pm: Brian and Sharon and Kat arrive! Brian has the last of the camp lights with him. I get on zip-tying those to the shade structure and connecting them to the power mains.
      7:00pm: Danin and Allison arrive, gifting more of their apple pie moonshine. This is the ultimate bad decision sauce. Again. Still.
      7:05pm: Evapotron online. Kind of.
      7:30pm: I get the last of the camp lighting installed and powered.
      8:15pm: We begin stitching WoD panels onto the frame. I struggle to find ways to be useful.
      8:45pm: Decide the best way for me to be useful is to practice relaxing and holding space for myself.
      9:30pm: Start patching the holes in the sides of Thing2 with scraps of wood that Michael sawed out of some spare particle board.
      10:30pm: Tautology sound check -- all systems go!
      10:45pm: Unwinding with Kendra, Kat, and Wes in my tent.
      11:06pm: Make a note to tell Ethan that the new crossover configuration on the sound stage sounds really good. It can sound a touch better in the lower ranges, and what we have right now Does Not Suck At All (tm). Parts of our sound system were designed by noise cancellation research scientists who calibrate the very concept of time for the US government. To say it's simultaneously "loud" and "clear" are both dramatic understatements.
      11:15pm: Power goes out in camp. Main generator out of fuel. Michael and I rectify it and make sure others know how to fuel and restart the generators.
      11:45pm: Playing classical guitar for Wes, Alexa, Michael, David, and Rachel:
   Beethoven's Adagio Cantabile, from Sonata Pathetique, opus 14, number 8
   Aquilles Baez' La Casa Azul
   The traditional 15th-century classic, Romanza Espanol
   Franz Liszt's Liebestraum, number 3
   Steve Howe, Mood for a Day
   Bach's prelude to Cello sonata number 1
      Burn Week
   
      Sunday 8/28
   
      12:00am: Gates open. Burning Man 2016 begins. I'm in camp catching up with Michael.
      12:45am: Michael and I decide to retire for the evening.
      2:00am: Having trouble sleeping, decide to work on my techno set for Thursday.
      4:30am: Techno set is ready to rock.
      4:45pm: Met Kevin on the way back from the portos. Passed out in my tent shortly thereafter.
      12:14pm: Woke up, getting ready for the day. First order of business, removing the TRIGGER WARNING Early Arrival bracelet from my left arm.
      12:15pm: David is regaling SK with tales of Boner Battles, the martial art acted out with pool noodles. David brought plenty of pool noodles with him.
      1:00pm: Ready for the day, almost. Been searching for my photo ID for half an hour now. Pretty sure it's not anywhere in my tent.
      1:25pm: Give up looking for my ID.
      1:30pm: Good morning hugs with Brian and Steve
      1:35pm: Hanging out with Dreamscape and Tautology under the misting tent of the Margherita bar across the street.
      2:20pm: Met Savage in Tautology chill space.
      3:30pm: Syncing sound stage calendars with all of our neighbors (Thanks for handling comms with the bar, Kendra!) We decide to leave our sound stage off all day Wednesday so the orchestra across the street can rehearse for their big show.
      3:50pm: Sharon brings us all ice cream sandwiches!
      4:20pm: Building the Bad Advice Bar. I still prefer workahol to alcohol.
      4:30pm: Talking with Mike and Wes about computational meta-ethics and my research with Lifeboat Foundation.
      4:45pm: Scooting over to Dreamscape to kick it with Keith Salender for a bit.
      4:50pm: Met Doug from Rack'em'up on my way over to Party Naked Camp with Keith, SK, Mia, Doug, and some others from Dreamscape
      5:10pm: Oversocialized, heading to introvert in my tent for a bit. Thank goodness for tent fans and the new batteries Hope picked up for me during truck load.
      6:10pm: Jay and Sarah arrive! Help them unload and setup where their tent goes.
      6:30pm: There are now way more chairs than people in the social area. Space is becoming difficult to navigate. I find solace on the steps of the bus.
      6:45pm: Run into Michael and Kendra. Michael and I decide to start up the sound stage so I can play music for people while the team finishes stitching WoD.
      6:50pm: We haul all necessary gear to the top of the bus: folding table, DJ mixer, laptop, water, hoodie, a blanket, and a power strip.
      7:00pm: Sound check good, levels holding. I kick things off with some Rrose - Mirror.
   
         DJing must be the perfect hobby for mid-to-high functioning Autistic people. 
         I get to rock gently back and forth, listening to music I like while making strange
         beatbox mouth noises--in public. Nobody seems to think this is weird. I don't 
         have to socialize unless I can and want to (social interaction is rewarding 
         but very difficult for me), and my friends appreciate and encourage this. 
         I get to hyper-associate and specialize deep in complex phylogenies of
         sub-sub-sub genres. And again, this not weird for DJs. This is expected.
   
         Plus, if you build good subwoofers and configure your sound stack correctly, 
         it can meet your touch needs without a hug box or any actual human contact. 
         Below 20Hz, sound is touch. I'm uncertain whether this is healthy.
   
      8:30pm: David brings me hugs, then water and more hugs.
      9:00pm: Alexa comes up to ask for more dancey music. I switch to house music and promise lots of cats in the mix. If you hear "boots and cats" music, you're probably listening to some kind of house.
   
         * House: boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and
         * Techno: boots and bits and bets and bats and boats and bots and
         * Drum and Bass: boot tit cat tit tit boot cat tit
         * Trance: Ba da da da ba da da da ba da da da ba da da da
         * Psytrance: Bwa da da da bwa da da da bwa da da da bwa da da da
   
         Within house music:
   
         * Tech house: House music made with techno instruments (i.e. analog electronics)
         * Deep house: House music with layered, more tribal rhythms and samplers
         * Electro house: House music made with electro instruments (e.g. the infamous 808)
         * Acid house: House music made with acid instruments (i.e. the Roland TB-303)
         * Prog house: House music compositionally influenced by progressive rock
         * Dub house: House music that's softened by recording it over itself (cf. dub techno)
   
         Past this point, it's more descriptive than proscriptive (e.g. "psychedelic tech house") and frequently outright absurd ("bike shed house", "shrub step", "sensitive white boy stepcore", etc). 
   
         I play multi-genre, but mostly techno.
   
      10:00pm: The wind is picking up. I'm mixing with one hand and using the other to keep my laptop from flying off the top of the bus and shattering into hundreds of tiny laptoplets. A spontaneous gathering of fire dancers performs on our dance floor. They appear to be having a hard time getting their fire toys lit.
      10:30pm: Lia comes up to say hello! I hug her with one arm, since the other is still keeping things from blowing away.
      10:45pm: Andréa Waite is here! I give her a similar hug.
      10:50pm: Daniel installs a flamethrower on the bus.
      11:00pm: Fire dancers have mostly wrapped up. I switch to dub techno to chill things out for the evening.
   
      Monday, 8/29
      ------------
      12:00am: I wrap up the first set of our 2016 BRC sound stage with HVOB - Clap Eyes, Christian Löffler - The War, and Kiasmos - Bent. Don't want to wear out our welcome with our neighbors. I pack up my sound gear and climb back down to spend time in the social area in camp.
      12:30am: Briefly catch up with Lia, Andréa, Wes, Kendra, and Alex
      1:30am: Bill Ratcliffe arrives, riding out with Maria Michaelson. And of course he knows Steve. David and I take stock of available tent space v. the known number of people still inbound. Still expecting Colin, Radiance, Joe, and Zobeewa.
      2:00am: Porto trip and laying down for the night.
      3:30am: Trying to sleep, restlessly. Trying to let go of dad and Larry. Eager for the temple to open so I can leave their photos. And I still have no idea where my photo ID is. 
      4:00am: Some days, I feel like I'm only just barely high-functioning.
      11:30am: Woken by Daniel looking for some parts for the flamethrower. I dig around in my tent and find them for him.
      11:35am: Greeted Em and Dane and Radiance, who have all arrived!
      11:45am: Met Abstract and Danielle, whom Radiance came down with. They're setting up a tea lounge on some of Tautology's unused frontage. Abstract and I have a passion in common: We're both mathematicians who aimed to go into logic but ended up as geometers.
      11:50am: I heard Colin's voice through my tent and am unable to find the Colin.
      12:20pm: Up and ready to roll over to Mark and Ty's Shitshow.
      12:30pm: Showing Ethan how to use my Traktor S5 controller. 
      12:40pm: I learn that the shower at Mark and Ty's is public. I'm not yet comfortable being naked in public, so I decline to head over with Kendra. Maybe next year.
      12:45pm: Kicking off another set. Starting things off right with Erothyme - Thousand Hands of God. I guess I feel like playing more music for people!
      1:20pm: K-Zar from Dreamscape stops by to say hello.
      1:30pm: Michael, Kendra, and Mark stop by to say hello. Lots of compliments on the music.
      1:40pm: Bill Ratcliffe is back from the ARTery. His deep playa art installation placement is at 11:55 and 666 feet, just a little bit west of a giant can of soup.
      3:30pm: Jenn Dolan, Jesse, Chris, and Ashley are here! WO RAI DO DA!
      3:50pm: FAST approves our flamethrower. The flame test that gets us the green light occurs right at the main crescendo in Sigur Rós - Viðrar vel til loftárása. Approved with style, Daniel!
      4:00pm: At 120BPM, the flamethrower can run for 16 beats before the accumulator start to go weak on propane pressure. Writing things down makes it possible to do science!
      4:20pm: Andrea Pollitt and Chris White stop by to say hello.
      4:25pm: Dano! and Ashley are here! Party time on top of the bus.
      4:46pm: Liz Culverson stops by to say hello and tell me she's taking Radiance out tonight, as soon as she can find her. I bid her the best of luck. She calls Radiance "my girl", like many folks in the Seattle rave communities assume. I offer kind corrections that while Radiance and I are inseparably close friends who go to most events together and are either occasionally or regularly attracted to women, we are not and have never been a romantic couple.
      5:00pm: Putting on a two-hour board recording of a previous set of mine so the gear will still be up here, running, and ready when Ethan gets back home to play his set tonight.
      6:10pm: Tying the netting of the I-can't-believe-this-isn't-a-trampoline mini-WoD to the trampoline frame with the help of a few dozen passers-by.
      6:20pm: Bill, Elizabeth, Paul, Jeff, and Michael from Seaweed stop by to say hello!
      7:00pm: Cuddling with Bill, Elizabeth, and Jeff in my tent.
      9:00pm: Ramen dinner (actually good ramen) across the street with Kendra, David, and Elizabeth.
      9:30pm: Hastily zip tie some EL wire and inverters to my bike, then head out with David for our annual Monday-of-burning-man date night.
      9:45pm: Pass a large medusa head. Exquisitely crafted.
      9:50pm: The man base. Still under construction.
      10:15pm: The temple. Still under construction.
      10:30pm: We happen upon a vacant deep playa installation shaped like a bomb in a box. We settle in and connect on needs, expectations, boundaries, etc.
      11:55pm: David and I decide to stop calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend, but to hold all of the existing aspects of his and my relationship consistent. We're working very well, just platonically. Calling me, David, and his wife Melley a triad doesn't seem forthright to the substance of our current bonds. I've tried for almost exactly two years, and I'm just not romantically attracted to fellas. I'm emotionally attracted to men and to women, but only physically attracted to women. And I'm fairly asexual, which isn't meeting many of David's needs other than for companionship (which we have in spades, platonically). And Melley and I have tried as well, and she's just not romantically attracted to ladies. The three of us are inseparably close friends, and it's most accurate for us to simply call it that and stay close with the same patterns and habits that have kept us close for the past many years.
   
      Tuesday 8/30
   
      12:25am: David and I run into Daniel, Lauren, Jesse, and Kyle at the deep playa portos. We remind each other that we love each other.
      12:30am: David and I are back in camp, cuddling in the squish.
      12:45am: David heads to sleep to be ready for his alpha ranger shift tomorrow. I spend more time with Alexa in the squish, catching up on things.
      1:30am: Alexa and I are joined by Kendra and Michael.
      2:30am: The four of us head to Nym's noise show: The Age of Terminal Static.
      2:45am: We arrive at center camp while Nym is sound checking and getting into his bumblebee mask. He opens his set by playing some very loud static while shouting "OH MY GOD THERE'S A BEE IN THE ROOM" repeatedly into the microphone. There are six people other than us in the audience here in center camp. For the next hour or so, he plays loud, grinding, noisy explosions, screams, and layers of static for us. His fry-voice vocals of doom build a dark counterpoint as he jumps and thrashes around on stage. At one point, he accidentally breaks his MIDI controller. This is unlike any show I've ever seen or heard. By the end of it, we four are the only ones watching. We give him a standing ovation, this year's Tautology pendant, and lots of hugs. Then we head back to camp.
      4:15am: Back in camp, in the cuddle, joined by Steve. 
      4:45am: I fall asleep in the cuddle and miss Em's show at center camp (that I later hear that Dane recorded, thankfully).
      1:30pm: Woke up to people talking just outside my tent. I email Melley about my and David's conversation, since our terminology decision clearly affects her as well. And I make a note to email Rebecca as well, my now-former metamour through David, with whom I'm very close.
      2:00pm: Right wrist in not inconsiderable pain again. Ibuprofen and brace.
      2:15pm: Alexa and Radiance stop by my tent to say hello.
      2:30pm: Good mornings to Zobe, Michael, and Kendra.
      2:45pm: Final adjustments to DJ lineup confirmed, I tape the schedule on the side of the bus.
      3:00pm: Electrolytes and sunscreen. Am I ready for the day?
      3:10pm: Head to Cleu Camp with Bill Ratcliffe.
      3:35pm: Arrived at Cleu Camp, gifted with a new cleu pendant to replace the one I had for three years but lost at a party a few weeks ago. Good conversations about quantum cryptography with others in line to meditate on Consciousness, Life, Earth, and the Universe (CLEU) together.
      4:00pm: Brainwashing. I needed that.
      4:45pm: At organic fruit and vegetable camp with Bill, meet Alex from the Seattle rave community. They share tomatoes and melons with us, and Alex gifts Bill with organic, home-made hand sanitizer. 
      4:50pm: Bill is off to do his radio show on Radio Free Burning Man. I head out to find Emily Elizabeth from the Dogfish art car a few days ago. I don't have Wes' bowler hat with me, but I suppose she'll forgive the oversight if she's interested in adventuring tonight with me, Andrea, and Chris.
      5:05pm: I make it to Houpitoria at 2:30 and F, and run into Battery and Aaron. They tell me Gandi is camped here, but Emily is at another camp at 4:30 and L. I leave a note for Gandi inviting him to come spend some time at Tautology (since he's also really cool) and head to 4:30 and L. Sorry, Linenoise, your princess is in another castle!
      5:15pm: Through a white-out dust storm, having run out of water fifteen minutes ago, I make it to 4:30 and L. I ask every camp along each block if Emily is around. None of these camps contain an Emily. Crestfallen, dehydrated and still without a bowler hat, I mosey on over to Seaweed.
      5:25pm: On my way, I happen upon Hippocampus. I stop in to see if Markus or Tanesha are around, to invite them to my techno set on Thursday. Shawn tells me he's in the shower. She comes from Tasmania and gladly offers a half-liter of water. I leave a note for them and make tracks.
      5:36pm: Met up with Ivy at Black Rock Boutique, and made plans to grab coffee with her at Center Camp tomorrow afternoon. She gifts me with a lovely BRC necklace. I give her her Tautology pendant.
      6:20pm: Found Seaweed in Rogue Nation Village. Run into Todd, Jeff, Bill, Elizabeth, Hawaii, 
      Paul, Howard, and so many others! Cuddled with Todd and Jeff. Todd gifts me with a lovely Buddhist prayer necklace. Ohmmmmmm. I'm out of Tautology pendants in my purse, but have one saved for him in my tent.
      7:00pm: Back at Tautology camp, eating, cleaning up, and getting ready to head out with Andrea and Chris whenever they stop by for tonight's adventure date.
      7:45pm: Note to send Shadows art installation code to Mike Helland.
      8:00pm: Started main generator to run the sound stage for Dreamscape's open decks.
      8:10pm: Wondering when Andrea and Chris are going to come by. Coordinating spacetime is intractably squishy in the dust, as usual.
      8:12pm: Bill Ratcliffe and I start planning out our pirate radio station. I note to check the spreadsheet of rogue transmitters in this desert to make sure I can get a spot that doesn't step on anyone else's feet.
      8:15pm: Keith Salender kicks off Dreamscape open decks with a killer atmospheric drum and bass set.
      9:30pm: Boner Battle world championships happening on Web of Dreams
      9:30pm: Keith Kocienski plays an incredible Happy Hardcore set. With Banjos. Banjocore.
      11:30pm: Leaving my tent for just a moment, Kendra and Michael invite me to head out to a deep playa bar with them. This bar involves solving riddles in order to decode a password to enter the bar. Sounds like fun!
   
      Wednesday, 8/31
   
      12:00am: Getting ready to head out with Kendra and Michael.
      12:30am: They show me this incredible deep playa installation of concentric circles that transmit light at the speed of sound. We bike through its entire length, then turn to the right and head to the puzzle bar.
      12:40am: We arrive at the bar and feverishly start writing down questions and arranging possible letters. We don't notice that they're still changing out some of the questions from last night.
      1:45am:  A participant who borrows my pocketknife tells me the temple is now open. 
      2:00am: We double-check some of the questions. Some of them have changed. The instructions now make sense. The password "cat's meow" lets us into the bar. We get drinks, popcorn, and swag, and head back to camp.
      2:15am: Michael breaks off to try and find the Dusty Diner. Kendra and I head back to camp.
      3:00am: I decide to call it a night and head to sleep. Did I actually make it to Wednesday of burn week before having my first emotional breakdown in my tent? I think so! That's progress.
      12:00pm: Woken up by conveniently-timed hammering next to my tent, scramble to head to Black Rock Boutique to meet up with Ivy.
      12:30pm: Arrive at Black Rock Boutique, find Ivy, catch my breath, refill on water, and head to Center Camp to catch up and connect.
      12:35pm: Introduce Ivy to Brian and Steve from Tautology and WoD, who've just gotten off Dazzle's art tour and are still near center camp.
      12:50pm: Introduce Ivy to Nym and Kyle
      1:20pm: Invite Ivy to Tautology adventure night, since she doesn't have plans on Friday and would fit in well with the family. And is already a part of the Tautology art collective, just not our camp this year. I bid her a good afternoon as I point my bike back towards home.
      1:25pm: My derailleur explodes near 6:00 and Rod's Road, sending pieces of gears flying all over the road. I dismount and quickly moop sweep, dodging and weaving through thick pedestrian and bike traffic.
      1:28pm: The camp I broke down in front of has a large block of ice out in front. For passers-by, they cool off their hands, then place them on your neck to cool off your blood. It's really nice.
      1:30pm: Derailleur is all tangled up in my rear wheel, which now refuses to turn. I drag my bike back through the desert heat to my camp, around one mile away. Out of water. Again. I really need to start carrying more than 1 liter everywhere.
      2:02pm: Back in camp, sensing my multiple sclerosis starting to act up, most likely due to the heat. Nerve Conduction Velocity feels low in my left leg--it's dragging a bit behind my right. Decide that cooling off is my first priority.
      2:05pm: Jesse / Sprocket offers hugs and assurances that he can convert my bike into a fixie.
      2:08pm: I hear that the sit-and-spinny thing out front in camp has sheared off, and that there were no injuries. The chunk of metal formerly called our spinny thing rests unceremoniously by the fuel depot behind the bus.
      2:10pm: Dane offers to grab some frozen drinks from across the street. I smile, thank him, and hand him my cup.
      2:35pm: Talking with Sara about life trajectories and plans, and with Ethan about sound stack configurations.
      3:30pm: NCV feels like it's no longer getting worse (thankfully, due to DJing, I have a really well-honed sense of rhythm, and when parts of my body /should/ move when I tell them to, compared to when they /do/ move). I don't have the parts to build an NCV tester out here, so have to wing it a bit.
      3:45pm: Head to Dreamscape to borrow a soldering iron, since Aaron from Dreamscape borrowed mine yesterday for their LED hula hoop workshop. 
      3:50pm: We find my butane soldering iron; I head back to Tautology. We've got some lights to put together in camp. I ask if anyone in the chill space wants to learn how to solder. Rachel and Sharon volunteer!
      4:10pm: I setup an impromptu soldering workshop on my DJ mixer case next to the main power pole under the shade structure. We go through wire stripping, gauges, how to use a butane soldering iron, what solder is and how it works, electrical basics (DC and AC), and basics of testing connectivity with a meter.
      4:30pm: Dashiell stops by to say hello! Dr. Dash. He just defended his Ph.D. dissertation on quantum optics, and tells us all about his research as we sit attentively spellbound. I introduce him to Rachel, Sharon, and Michael.
      4:35pm: Wrap up the soldering workshop, back to rigging together an internet connection from a pile of phones and laptops so I can track down a safe frequency for our pirate radio station to use.
      5:00pm: Pirate radio transmitter configured and tested at 99.5 MHz. Ready to make some waves!
      6:00pm: Relaxing in camp, getting ready for Tautology family night.
      7:10pm: I have to get this out of my head before we get into family night. Writing done on dad and Larry's photos to be left in the temple.
   
         The day I set foot on playa last year, my father went into surgery to get another stint after yet another heart attack. A few months later, on November 19th, 2015, he died of complications from this surgery. And by "he died," I mean "his wife unplugged his life support after erasing me and my twin sister from the will" He wasn't speaking to me for the last few years of his life, nor was he able to talk in his final days, but his wife had the heart to call my cell and hold it up to his ear a few moments before unplugging him. What I wrote on his photo were the last words I came up with to say to him when she called. He was a scientist for the air force, then an engineer for IBM for thirty years, then retired to be a professor once he hit sixty. I wrote in my best handwritten Helvetica Light, since he was very strict. The kerning I ended up with was close enough.
   
         Written on Dad's photo:
         Randy Herman Stayskal, 9/28/1953--11/19/2015. 
         I love you, I miss you, I forgive you, I'm sorry.
         Love, your daughter
   
         My uncle Larry died on the same morning that November, also of heart problems--but three hours away in Buda, Texas, down by Austin. Larry was a folk musician (like my mother / his sister / Alexa's second cousin once removed), a carpenter, and at the end of his life as the foreman of the construction crew he'd put in so many years with in the Texas heat. Larry's role in the family was to make sure we all had instruments and basic musical training (which is now apparently my role). When I was very small and my hands were very small, he was the first one to wrap them around the neck of a guitar in the correct way and tell me "This is C-major." When I turned 18, he got everyone in the family to pool any available money, then brought me to Guitar Center and spent hours playing every guitar in the store until we found one that was right for me. Larry was wild, weird, and one of the few reasons I'd look forward to returning to Texas for holidays.
   
         Written on Larry's photo:
         Ride on, space cowboy!
   
      7:30pm: I hand these photos to Alexa, who knew both dad and Larry as well, so she can write whatever she likes on them. She writes on Larry's and hands it back to me. She declines to write on my father's photo. He was not an easy man to be close to.
      8:00pm: Tautology family night begins with a brief talk about consent, boundaries, expectations, and how to communicate about them from David. 
      8:05pm: Dano! and Ashley stop by to be close to us!
      8:10pm: Climb on top of the bus to spend some time with Bill and Lia
      8:15pm: Got a friendship bracelet from Lauren
      8:20pm: Gandi stops by to say hello! I introduce him to the other rangerly people in camp (David, Sarah, Mark), then bring him over to the bus.
      8:22pm: Kyle Mack stops by! He's trying to find us so he knows where to tell people to come for his big DJ set tomorrow. I show off our sound stage and flamethrower.
      8:25pm: Alone with Gandi on the bus. Gandi is an excellent kisser.
      9:00pm: Playing classical guitar for anyone who wants to listen under the Tautology shade. Most of the same five songs I've been practicing, since I'm going to play them as part of my classical set on Friday afternoon.
      9:30pm: Connecting with Kendra and Steve
      10:00pm: Cuddle pile on the dance floor with just about everyone in camp! Spending a lot of time with Sarah and with Daniel.
   
      Thursday 9/1
   
      12:20am: Fire spinning on the dance floor and people getting flogged on Web of Dreams. What a night. I sit close with Sarah who's having back pain.
      1:00am: Spending time with Dane, then headed to the cuddle area with Alexa, Savage, David, and Rachel. Been looking forward to spending time with Dane for many months now!
      1:20am: Joined in the cuddle by Zobe, in a conversation about gender and conservative upbringings.
      2:00am: Bill Templeton stops by at the end of a very hard night for him, looking for warmth and a place to cool his feet. I give him food and water and love and comfort, wrap him up in my sleeping bags and blankets, and show him to my cot to lay down for the night.
      2:30am: EMTs show up in camp to help Sarah with her back pain, which is now overwhelming.
      3:30am: I retire for the night, curled up on some blankets in my tent on the ground by my desk.
      5:00am: Woke up with Elizabeth's arms around me, overwhelmed with bliss. Note: I found out after the fact that she had no idea the man curled up on my cot was Bill. When I woke up with her next to me, I just quietly shushed and pointed at the sleeping person in my cot. Hawaii also comes in, and the three of us sit on the ground in my tent and catch up for a bit on the happenings of the night. I give her a Tautology pendant to give to Todd Smith in her camp. They stick around for a few minutes, after which I promptly fall back asleep on the blankets.
      7:00am: Bill wakes up and moseys home after a hug and some more water. I move to my cot.
      2:00pm: I wake up dreadfully hot.
      2:45pm: Heading to the temple with David to leave dad and Larry's photos.
      3:10pm: We hit another white-out dust storm on the bike ride out. My bike is running like a dream, BTW. Thanks again, Sprocket! David and I find an IKEA loveseat setup in deep playa to cuddle on until the dust clears enough for us to get our bearings on the temple.
      3:20pm: White-out storm stops. We get our bearings and head to the temple.
      3:30pm: I hang my father's photo in the temple, with David close.
      3:40pm: I hang Uncle Larry's photo in the temple, also with David close.
      3:45pm: I'm crying strongly enough that I give myself an asthma attack. I fumble through the tears, digging in my purse looking for one of the inhalers I brought to the playa with me. I find one, become able to breathe again, and when I wipe my tears I see Colin in front of me, arms outstretched. He holds me until I'm able to see, stand, talk, and center again.
      4:10pm: Colin heads back to camp to hear Radiance's DJ set, which has probably just begun. I hold David while he leaves the things he needs to leave here.
      4:15pm: I decide not to leave my Floodland pendant in the temple. I brought it with me to leave, but now think it would be inappropriate. I /was/ part of Floodland, and those were amazing, pivotal experiences for me. I decide to hold on to that. It doesn't go in the temple. It goes in the brown box of things that bring me happy memories, back at home in Seattle. After helping make the first two Floodlands happen (note: these are anarchist raves in central Washington), I'm no longer a part of the Floodland community as of a few months ago. This is voluntary on my part, due to a lack of communicated or enforced safety standards in that community.
      4:30pm: Temple business wrapped up. I don't need or want to come back here until they light this all on fire on Sunday. Leaving things in the temple means leaving things in the temple (It's tautologically delicious that way). Not owning the parts of them that aren't also now a part of you, and not letting them drag you along in whatever directions are chosen by your cadre of hungry ghosts. Own the parts that are also part of you. Let go of the parts that aren't.
      4:45pm: Back in camp, listening to the tail end of Radiance's wonderful DJ set! 
      5:00pm: Bill Templeton and Elizabeth stop by to say hello and do some science.
      5:15pm: Mark is here with hugs and warmth. We talk about some of the Gates Foundation research that I'm adjacent to while not directly being involved with. He comes up with an idea based on their mosquito laser fence that might help prevent future occurrences of bee colony collapse disorder. I make a note to put Mark in touch with this research crew at my old lab in Seattle. We talk about the different pathways of spiritual energy throughout and around the last four temples. Mark is definitely awake and tuned in.
      5:30pm: Joe Breman arrives from Hawaii, a DARPA friend of mine! I introduce him to other ridiculously smart people in camp. We seem to have a lot of those this year, and in general.
      6:30pm: Climbing on top of the bus to spend time with Zobe, Donna (her partner), and Greg (Donna's husband).
      7:00pm: Saying hello to Chris and Ashley while Radiance plays Luke's remix of Led Zeppelin - Ramble On.
      7:30pm: Kyle Mack shows up to play his house set!
      8:45pm: A neighboring camp shows up with food and ask us to pull our speakers out to the street and face them at our camp. We don't have the hardware to accommodate that request (our speakon cables are only 25 feet long), but are able to meet the intent of their request by turning it down a bit. I drop the mains by 2db. And cut the Things down by 0.5db. Sounds better from the street now. Or at least easier to hold on a conversation. Next year we need to remember to pack monitors.
      9:00pm: Kyle Mack draws the biggest crowd of anyone so far! Thirty or forty people dancing in front of the bus, by my rough count. Kyle is also a data scientist by trade who DJs electronic music on our sound stage.
      9:15pm: At Bill Ratcliffe's suggestion, I move our pirate radio transmitter to 97.1 MHz to avoid a potential conflict with Radio Free Black Rock City later tonight.
      9:30pm: Getting ready for my techno set.
      10:00pm: My techno set begins. This one's for you, dad. Deep, tribal techno (or really anything other than christian and country music) was never his thing, and it's not super danceable. But it's a thing that I've been studying for decades now and know how to do very well. It's meditative, powerful, and centering for me.
      10:15pm: Audience clears out of the dance floor (many of them I know in person are very close to Kyle), except a dozen or two hippies hanging on to Web of Dreams, listening intently.
      11:45pm: WTF, there's actually someone out there on the dance floor trying to dance to this.
   
      Friday, 9/2
   
      1:00am: Close out my techno set with one of my latest tracks, then a quick remix of Prodigy - Narayan. One of my childhood favorites, and the first techno track I ever played for my father (to show off a speaker cabinet and crossover matrix I made for my little Honda civic back in high school). He didn't get it then, and probably wouldn't get it now either. That's okay. I shut off the mains and climb down off the bus.   1:15am: Looking around camp for Joe, since we had tentative plans to check out art for the night.
      1:30am: Can't find the Joe. Passing out for the night.
      12:00pm: Woke up in camp, well rested. Getting ready for the day. Nerve Conduction Velocity feels like it's more or less back to normal--having no trouble standing, balancing, or walking at this point today.
      12:30pm: Heading over to Dreamscape to say hello to Audrey. I heard they were going to arrive at some point on Wednesday, but haven't seen them around yet.
      1:00pm: Hanging out in camp talking about quantum computation with Dane and Jay.
      1:30pm: Talking about our favorite parts of our favorite burns with Brian, Kevin, Dane, David, and Lia.
      2:00pm: Head out to find my Maui friends (Jerry and Lorrayne) and Seattle friends peppered around Tokyo Sektor.
      2:15pm: Found Jerry and Lorraine at Red Lightning! Exchanged hugs, gifts, stories, machinations, and love. I plan on heading back to Maui at some point in the spring (probably with Rebecca or Radiance) some time when they're putting on another maker faire out there.
      2:25pm: Found Big Imagination camp (the one with the front part of the 747, just like 2013), but can't find Michael Manahan anywhere. I leave a Tautology pendant for him on their whiteboard with a note and a few ASCII hearts (<3). He's their sound engineer. I can't find their lighting engineer, either (Dave), who invited me over to check out his build.
      2:30p: Back at camp, getting my modern classical set in order. Three hours of my favorite high-fidelity classical music that's been composed and recorded in the past decade. I decide to make an exception for Phillip Glass, since his compositions have been so very influential on the modern classical world, but were technically composed a few decades ago.
      2:45pm: Bill Templeton brings Jenny and Amber by to introduce them to me! We compare life notes, trajectories, and passions. I nervously fumble for words trying to explain my artificial intelligence research to two stunning, confident, centered, and present women.
      3:00pm: I start my modern classical set. Uncle Larry, this one's for you.
      3:15pm: Eric Shurman stops by to say hello! He's one of the Seattle folks I was just trying to find. Serendipity.
      3:30pm: Gregg from the Inflection build stops by with his wife to say hello!
      4:00pm: David brings me water! I needed that. And he probably knew that.
      4:30pm: Dano! and Ashley stop by to say hello and ecstatically dance, right around when I'm starting to play some recent recordings of an incredible Japanese glockenspielist. 
      5:15pm: David and Rachel do shibari on WoD.
      5:30pm: Dane brings me hugs (squeeee!) and generally checks on me.
      5:45pm: Bill Ratcliffe stops by to check on me and the prayer flags. "Looks like the prayer flags worked." I agree.
      6:00pm: Closing the modern classical set with one of my favorite recent recordings by Ólafur Arnalds. He does such amazing work, both independently and as a part of Kiasmos (who I played on Monday at midnight).
      6:30pm: Gifted with a small piece of quartz by someone who stopped me in the middle of the road on the way back from the portos. She tells me it focuses intentions. I could use more focused intention from time to time, and nestle it in the small pocket of my purse with thanks, a smile, and a hug.
      6:45pm: Eating, hydrating, getting ready for Tautology adventure night, and catching up with Andréa.
      7:00pm: Ready for adventure!
      7:30pm: Ivy stops by with Michael McCall, ready to head out with us!
      8:00pm: Tautology adventure night begins with a brief talk about consent, boundaries, expectations, and how to communicate about them from David. 
      8:15pm: We have some mobility-restricted people in camp who've arranged the Cloud Nine art car with our neighbors, Geisha House, to take our crew around on an art tour in inner playa tonight. Very thankful for all of them.
      9:10pm: We pile around thirty tautologists on our art car and head out to check out art and stop by the temple for the few in camp who can't make it out there on their own.
      9:48pm: Sarah falls into the engine compartment of the art car. Not seriously injured, thankfully, but gives us enough of a scare that we send a runner for medics. I make a note to send Michael notes on how to do this on the radios a bunch of us carry everywhere.
      10:10pm: Paramedics arrive and tend to Sarah.
      10:30pm: We head back to camp.
      10:45pm: Back at camp, thankfully no longer at the temple.
      11:30pm: Nope. Not enjoying this one bit. Pulling the parachute and passing out.
   
      Saturday, 9/3
   
      11:15am: Woken up by Alexa, who's out with DPW reclaiming bikes. She introduces me to her new fella, Trey Cruz.   12:00pm: Bill and Andréa bring me over to the installation they ...modified last night. The woman holding up the man holding up the question mark. It's been to playa a few times now.
   2014: A man holds up a question mark that's leaning heavily on him, arms square out to support the weight of presumably existential questioning, since this IS Burning Man.
   2015: Pretty much the same thing
   2016: A woman holds up the man who's holding up the question mark, which is still leaning heavily on him. Her arms are on his shoulders, his back is to her, and his arms are still holding up the leaning, heavy question mark.
   2016-mod-tautology: The woman now bears a large strap-on cock and balls fashioned out of a spool of rope, some tape, and some spare lights. You know, for those who are questioning. The patriarchy isn't going to fuck itself! Some questions require a healthy amount of lubrication.
      12:30pm: David makes bacon and Zobe makes coffee. Both are saints.
      1:00pm: Catching up with Dane, Andréa, Sarah, Elf, Abstract, and Colin in camp.
      1:45pm: Climbed on top of the bus to eat a can of chunked pineapple.
      2:00pm: Joined by Michael, eating yoghurt mixed some kind of corn chips.
      2:20pm: Heading back down to start packing up all of my things.
      3:20pm: Head over to Dreamscape for tambourine lessons! Me, Keith, Audrey, Keith, Ginny, Pasta, Jaye, Cyan, and Matteo improvise tambourines from various boxes filled with jangly metal cylinders around their tent. Finally ran into Audrey, who kindly offers some Thai iced tea! Told them we plan on running the sound stage all night tonight, on burn night, since so many of the louder art cars will be at the man burn. I plan on watching the burn from the top of the bus.
      4:20pm: Back in camp, catching up with Kendra, going to check up on our greywater evaporator which has now evolved into our greywater situation.
      5:00pm: Michael starts his set--his first DJ set ever! And it's mostly indie rock. Loving it.
      5:10pm: Meet Aditya from a neighboring camp who heard some of the music that Michael was playing, loved it as well, and came over to tag-team a DJ set with him! Aditya promptly and warmly joins the collective.
      5:20pm: Kevin tells us he found three more full condoms below Web of Dreams. That brings the running total to five this year. Four of which were full.
      5:30pm: Lia stops by my tent to gift some of Daniel's famous White Boy Enchiladas! Just as good as I remember from last year.
      6:00pm: Run into Aaron from Cloud Nine / Geisha House, coming by to check on Sarah. Gift him with a Tautology pendant to say thanks for driving us all around last night.
      6:30pm: My go bag is packed for Sunday, and I'm ready for man burn.
      7:00pm: I start my man burn sunset session with Padre - Chasing Mirrors. Then HVOB - Turn a Rope Round its Axis.
      8:00pm: White-out dust storm--with rain! I shut everything down, pack up all equipment, and get it moved back into my tent in under ten minutes. We switch from the 7kW generator to the 2kW one, since we're shutting off the sound stage.
      8:15pm: All electronics in camp are secure, and we're huddled below some popups in camp listening to BMIR while the smaller generator keeps the lights on.
      8:30pm: The rain stops, and we all climb on top of the bus to watch the man burn. Cuddles with Sarah, David, Rachel, sitting next to Sharon and Brian
      9:30pm: Commentary on BMIR becoming increasingly inane. Overheard from camp, not over BMIR: "Yes, friends, we're still waiting for the winds to die down so they can light this man on fire. How are things looking back at the station, Mike? Well, Tom, I'm masturbating furiously. And here's Mike with the weather."
      9:50pm: The man catches fire.
      10:15pm: The man falls. We joke about the wheel enclosing the Vitruvian man rolling him into the crowd, as if to say "fuck yer burn!"
      10:30pm: Energy work with Bill in my tent. I see Bill's face turn from a fifteen-year-old version of Bill back to dust and back to present Bill. 
   
         To make something sacred, first you call it sacred, then you hold it sacred. 
         One life behind all forms.
   
      Sunday, 9/4
   
      12:45pm: Good night, Black Rock City. Need to get some good rest for teardown and pack-out tomorrow.
      8:35am: Woken by Daniel walking through camp telling people to go help Kendra tear down WoD.
      10:00am: Done packing, labeling, indexing, and taping my personal things.
      10:30am: Lights and sound stage are down and packed up.
      11:00am: Daniel makes bacon. Radiance is our bacon fairy.
      1:00pm: Shade starts coming down.
      2:25pm: Shade structure is down. Wow. That was really fast.
      3:00pm: Aditya brings by the Sufi Book of Life that I read while sitting next to Kendra in the shade of the bus.
      3:05pm: Ethan shares the best joke he heard this week: How many burners does it take to setup a carport? Fuck! We forgot to pack the carport!
      4:20pm: Initial line sweep of Tautology, picking up MOOP.
      5:10pm: Second line sweep of Tautology. No MOOP to be found.
      5:45pm: Alex, Bill Ratcliffe's friend stops by to say hello.
      6:00pm: Maria stops by to pick up Bill Ratcliffe.
      6:30pm: Bus and truck load complete. We're ready to go.
      6:45pm: We're heading, through a whiteout, over to Pink Lightning to pick up Rachel. Some neighbors have the road blocked off by a tarp. In a whiteout. We drive over their tarp.
      7:00pm: Ready to head to the temple burn together, distributing abandoned dusty blankets to some very cold ravers.
      7:20pm: Walking quietly solemly to the temple, along with much of the rest of Black Rock City, as bagpipes play softly in the distance. David and I keep each other warm on the way there as I fight back more tears.
      7:40pm: At the temple burn perimeter, we find a good spot for our tribe near the FAST depot on the 9:00 side of the burn. Cuddling in with Dane, Em, David, Rachel, Daniel, Lauren, Lia, Derek, Ethan, Jesse, Savage, Steve, Michael, and Kendra. Alexa is notably absent, off with DPW somewhere, due to her injured foot, probably on the Strap-on van with Trey and pals. A very talented violinist plays a few feet away from us.
      8:15pm: The temple is lit on fire. Dane and I scoot closer, hold hands, and keep each other warm.
      8:45pm: The temple falls.
      9:15pm: The perimieter falls. Dane and I still close, keeping each other warm. Savage brings out a bottle of champagne to share between the crew. We express love to each other, down the bottle between the eight or ten or so of us left standing together here, and break to head back home via the portos.
      10:10pm: We're home. Warm goodbye-for-now hugs and kisses all around. I get on the bus with Michael, Kendra, and Ethan to head out.
      10:20pm: We stop by Mark and Ty's Shitshow to donate one of our 55-gallon drums of water that we weren't even able to start finishing this week. We pause at their camp for steak and garlic bread and connecting with their band of dusty weirdos. They too seem to have good taste in people to keep close.
      10:45pm: We hear over BMIR that gate is closed for an amber alert. We settle in next to Mark and Ty's campfire. Kendra digs around on her phone and finds out it's a seventeen year old girl who is out with her 31 year old boyfriend and missed temple burn with her group.
      11:30pm: We hear over BMIR (which is playing a lot of great Bowie right now, BTW) that gate is re-opened, subject to vehicle inspections. We load back into the bus and get going.
      11:32pm: I review for the bus crew my best understanding of our legally defensible positions to get through gate during an amber alert but still holding fast on our collective policy on not consenting to search. If they come on board looking for a person, and find something they don't like that's not the person they're looking for, it can't be admitted to court without probable cause, a warrant, or a subpoena. Not that we have anything to hide, but rights are vitally important for their own sake.
      11:45pm: Rangers tell us the gate is closed and tell us to pull over and wait. We comply.
      11:50pm: BMIR says gate is open. We start the bus and head to the gate.
      11:55pm: Different rangers tell us the gate is still closed and tell us to pull over and wait. Somewhere, these folks aren't communicating effectively. We pull over and comply.
   
      Monday, 9/5
   
      12:00am: Again, BMIR tells us the gate is open, but vehicles are subject to search. We ignore these and all successive rangers flagging us to pull over. And we head to gate.
      12:20am: In line at gate, sleeping in 45-minute bursts, curled up next Ethan.
      12:27am: I have network access again, now that my devices are charged. First thing I do is email Rebecca about me and David's new relationship terminology (close friends, not boyfriend and girlfriend). She's my now-former metamour through him; she and I are very close. I pass out shortly thereafter
      8:20am: We can see paved road! Kendra and I get out to use the restroom and ask around for diesel mechanics who might be able to untangle some of our electrical problems on the bus. We're getting fluctuating readings on the 12v and 24v power rails depending on what's plugged in, turned on, turned off, running, or stopped. We've already replaced the alternator, and suspect the equalizer or wiring harnesses might be faulty. The diesel mechanic from Cloud City suggests it might be a battery problem, and to top ours off with distilled water. We have neither distilled water nor refillable batteries. We have a bank of four very large, but conventional sealed lead acid batteries running this thing.
      8:25am: Two people are doing yoga in the exodus line in-between two large trailers. I grab my yoga mat and join them. They show me a bunch of Kundalini yoga asanas. I learn their names: Satnam (from Victoria) and Joseph (from Utah), but neglect to catch their email addresses. My shoulders feel way better after sleeping curled up in a bus seat.
      8:30pm: Merging around a broken-down RV in the exodus line. Good thing our bus has a giant metal exoskeleton!
      9:15am: There are plants outside! Growing! On the ground!
      9:25am: Both the bus (Gertie) and the truck (Penelope, occasionally pronounced like "Antelope") are on pavement! From the time we left camp, our exodus clocks in at eleven hours this year. That's a record for me and or everyone else in our caravan (including Alexa and Steve in the truck).
      9:30pm: Traffic actually moving. Moving at the speed of love, baby. 17 MPH in a 31 MPH zone.
      9:35am: Kendra and I are dreaming / planning / dreaming about breakfast in Lakeside. Hash browns, biscuits and gravy, cold orange juice that doesn't taste like playa dust (aka Vitamin P)
      11:05am: Electrical systems acting up on the bus again. Pull over. Disconnect. Measure. Confirm. Reconnect. Everything works again. What the actual fuck. We get back on the road.
      11:30am: Back to Laughter and Forgetting.
      12:45pm: Food, fuel, and actual legit hand-washing with soap and water at Rabbit Traxx in Cedarville, CA. Faintly, I hear an actual bird actually tweeting for the first time in weeks. Ran into Cyan and Matteo from Dreamscape in the gas station corner store. Brian, Sharon, and Kat catch up with us. They left BRC at 4am today.
      1:45pm: Back on the road, heading to the place with the biscuits and the gravies.
      2:24pm: Three phones, one laptop, one speaker, a battery, a vaporizer, and a maddening tangle of three different kinds of USB cables are plugged into one brave little power strip running to the little inverter who could. Maybe we're just asking too much of the bus' electrical systems. All of our digital appendages are eagerly awaiting the first brush of contact with a cell tower just outside of Lakeside. Except the vaporizer, of course. That little critter's pretty shifty.
      3:00pm: Houston, we have cell signal. That's not run by USA COMNET, whoever that was. That was a reasonably powerful cell tower covering BRC this year (but planted in Gerlach), and not on a network or CLEC that I've ever seen in the wild. Make a note to track down who ran that and how the data was processed and routed, when their GSM-to-TCP/IP bridge was even functional. It seemed to be pretty overloaded by Wednesday of burn week. Perhaps Shadytel can bring some gear out next year so we can run a proper rogue phone network. Shadytel: We're not happy 'till you're not happy.
      3:17pm: Restrooms and breakfast at Jerry's Restaurant in Lakeside. Corned beef hash, eggs scrambled with cheese, iced tea, biscuits and gravy to share with Kendra, and mozzarella sticks to share with the table. Welcome to enlightenment, the lack of desire.
      4:45pm: Inbox zero, again.
      8:36pm: The emergency evacuation window partially pops out on the bus while we're heading down the road at highway speeds. Kendra quickly secures it and skillfully pulls it back in with a ratchet strap.
      9:17pm: More electrical problems, power rails fluctuating wildly. We pull over to a weigh station to debug. Gross weight of the bus: 24,000 lbs.
      10:30pm: Pulled over, the truck's power steering cable (part number 25-9520) popped off, conveniently, right next to where Cloud City's bus pulled over after losing half of their 12 Volt electrical systems as well. They have the 9/16ths socket we need to reattach our power steering belt, and we have electrical debugging knowledge to share with them. The playa provides, even on asphalt running through Mt. Hood.
      11:05pm: I make a note that I need to replace my socket sets again. Being mostly lesbian, that's the #2 most common thing for me to lose during a breakup / move-out. #1 for me is my cast iron skillet, which I've replaced now three times in the past ten years. But I still have all of my flannel and my boots! But that's probably because I'm very tall.
      11:30pm: The box truck starts, sounding MUCH better than before! Cloud city rolls off as well, with a diesel generator strapped to their roof, running, with cables dangling over the side connected to a trickle charger on their main battery. Sounds really familiar to a setup we discussed a few weeks ago before replacing the bus' alernator. We decline to board them to say goodbye, since they have someone on their bus with the flu. We express thanks to each other and make tracks.
      11:45pm: Box truck pulls over again, this time with a completely shredded power steering belt.
      11:53pm: We leave Ethan and Alexa with the truck, a pile of blankets, food, water, and an armload of candy. We take the bus and its failing electrical systems down the side of Mt Hood in search of a cell signal. I recall a 24-hour Walmart near Gresham, Oregon that might have the parts we need to fix the truck. So thankful that among our six travelers in this caravan, four of us are reasonably competent auto mechanics. And two of us are Texans. Meanwhile, the bus battery power levels are dropping precipitously--clock's ticking for us to make it to the next town.
   
      Tuesday 9/6
   
      12:24am: We have cell signal. I call the Walmart in Gresham, who doesn't have the parts we need (or any power steering belts, for that matter). What kind of Walmart is that? Michael calls AAA a few times before being able to successfully convince them to tow us to the auto parts store in Sandy, Oregon that opens earliest of all the ones Kendra can track down. We dispatch AAA back to halfway between mile markers 74 and 75 on route 26 and tell them we'll meet them there.
      1:03pm: Our generator is out of fuel. We track down some more and trickle charge our bus batteries enough to make it back to the box truck.
      2:10am: Bus power mains appear to be holding, and we hear back from AAA that they're on their way over to Penelope. We turn around and head back to meet them.
      2:15am: Everyone in the caravan comes within mere feet of our deaths as an impatient box truck tries to pass the bus at high speed as we crept uphill and pulled over to park next to our box truck. We and he swerved out of the way at the last minute, gear flying around in our bus. We take a moment to center and catch our breath.
      2:35am: Everyone safe and accounted for, we wait for the tow truck to catch up.
      2:45am: Tow truck arrives, and can only tow 6,000 lbs. Steve and I back-of-the-envelope guess how much weight is in our box truck. It's definitely within 10% of their limit. We decide to go for it.
      3:00am: Tow truck takes off with Penelope on its flatbed. We all head to the auto parts store in Sandy, Oregon that opens in four hours.
      4:00am: And now it's raining. The playa dust in the carpet and on the bikes on the roof promptly turns to corrosive mud.
      4:15am: Arrive at Advance Auto Parts in Sandy, Oregon. Park. Sleep for a few hours.
      7:30am: Woke up on the bus in the parking lot. Steve is underneath the box truck replacing the power steering belt and the necessary fluids. The crack in the radiator appears not to be leaking too badly. Alexa's foot pain is to the point where she can barely walk. I carry her from the bus back to the truck so we can head to breakfast together. She's getting good at walking on her heels.
      8:45am: Steve wraps up repairs on the truck. We head to a Denny's on the way back to Interstate 5.
      9:30am: Breakfast together at Denny's. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, coffee, and wheat toast with strawberry jam. And more coffee.
      10:00am: Michael climbs to the roof of the bus to re-attach some ratchet straps that've worked their way loose. 
      10:05am: We're back on the road to Seattle! Ethan and I promptly pass out on the bus.
      1:00pm: Woke up passing through Tacoma, because of the smell. The Tacoma Aroma (tm).
      2:30pm: Back at Michael and Kendra's, tetrising cars around to get the bus back into the driveway behind their house. We start unloading things.
      4:30pm: Bus is fully unloaded, and the first round of my things is loaded into my car to head back to my place near Renton. The military surplus antenna mast, three canopies, my tent, the box fan to cool off the amplifier rack, and the amplifier rack road case stay behind for round two. I appear to be missing my high-gain parabolic antenna that connects us to the BRC network operations center. Everything else fits snugly in my VW Jetta. And both my and Matt's bikes are strapped to the back of my car, neither of which obscuring my license plate (since I still cant' find my driver's license, but do have a temporary one handy if needed).
      4:40pm: Dropped off Matt's bike at Trevor's house. Heading home to unload and shower!
      5:37pm: Home, at my home in south Seattle. Setup one of my 10x10 popup canopies in the back yard so I don't get mud and dust everywhere while unloading.
      6:50pm: First batch of my stuff unloaded. Roommates happily greeted. Clean clothes located. Showering imminent.
      8:05pm: Clean! Off to dinner with Melley, because it's Tuesday. And Tuesdays are with Melley, even if we're no longer calling each other girlfriends. Customary back home from the playa dinner of Pad Kee Mao, medium spice, chicken at Lotus Thai in the Central District of Seattle. Home food.
      9:36pm: Heading back to Michael and Kendra's to pick up the last of my gear.
      10:24pm: At Michael and Kendra's, last of my gear loaded into my car. Michael texted saying the door is unlocked and to come in and say hi. The door is, however, locked, and he's not responding to texts. Assuming he's gone to sleep, I head home.
      11:00pm: Back home, unloading the last of my gear into the no-rain-right-here area under the popup in my back yard on the deck.
      11:07pm: Follow up with Helen about coming over tonight to catch up, now that she's back in town and about to move houses again.
      11:11pm: Follow up with Brice, Kyle, Jack, Alexa, Colin, Bill, and Elizabeth about the welcome back from BRC dinner tomorrow night. So very much looking forward to decompressing with many of my closest people tomorrow.
      11:26pm: Everything unloaded back at my place. Burnlog 2016 complete.
   
   All the love,
