  		The violent hum adrift from your lovingly macguyvered amplifiers before your last indie rock garage band show in Denton, a girl's nightmare flashlight party held together with old tape and regaining dignity on the Tokyo subway

		The hazy drive through night and day and tumbleweeds and night again until the first sight of a whole mountain with trees on the mountain when coming down the Columbia River gorge with a car full of all of your material belongings and a gleam of hope
