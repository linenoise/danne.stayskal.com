    <p>Five Years in the Desert is a compendium of Good Life Choices, chronicling the author's hour-by-hour first-hand experiences Burning Man Arts Festival in Gerlach, Nevada. Together, our heroes built massive art installations, coordinated camps, launched startups, ran pirate radio stations and massive flamethrower sound stages, recklessly holding things together under the baking desert sun with duct tape and love and whiskey.</p>

    <p>Because that which doesn't kill you only makes you weirder and harder to relate to.</p>

		  <p>Came out with my long-time friend Lawnchair's camp, Moonrock--while moving from Portland to Seattle--to my first burn. Overwhelmed by default-world changes and unable to reach out to connect, I spent a great deal of this burn alternating between having panic attacks in my tent and crying in deep playa. I met a lot of neat people, though, nearly all of whom I've stayed close to since then--especially so with the Potluck contingent who was camped with us this year, and with many old-school Moonrockers as well. My friend Reasonable from Portland, acting as my fairy ravemother for this event, is largely to thank for the modest amount of my emotional weight I was able to keep together this week. I decided that Black Rock City was a really neat place, but ultimately not my party. I didn't plan on returning.</p>

		  <h2><a href="/writing/burnlogs/burnlog_2014/index.html">Burnlog 2014</a></h2>

		  <p>So, a friend of mine got an art grant and she needs an engineer. I agree to do all of the engineering (power, structural, lighting, etc) for the Silk Road art installation. I camp with Moonrock again (in BRCSC's inaugural year), but spent most of my time with the people from our art project scattered around the playa who'd from this point on become the roots of Tautology. Oh, and I changed gender presentations (queer to female), pronouns (they to she), and started changing sexes (intersex to female). And my closest friend David the Good and I started dating, as I try to figure out whether or how I'm attracted to fellas. And I came out to my very conservative relatives in Texas. Past this point, my father and most of my relatives stopped speaking to me other than on holidays and about deaths. Oh, and I launched a tech startup from my tent. And wrote my second TED talk (to be given 11 days after exodus). And I couldn't walk for two days, due to my MS getting triggered heavily by the heat. Fun times, but overcommitment led quickly to burnout. I decided again not to come out again next year.</p>

		  <p>So, another friend of mine got an art grant for Inflection, the twisty rope bridge placed by The Man. He needs an engineer and support camp lead, which I agree to do. I build our shade structure, tend to all the spreadsheets and paperwork, gather the tribe, arrive a week early, survey the village, lead camp, build a bridge, burn a bridge, and return home safely. I successfully juggle commitments, nutrition (kind of--I'm still bad at that), companionship needs, and downtime, and have the first burn I actually really liked! Camped on Dirtrave Road with Tautology in Black Rock City Science Center, right next to Potluck (who brought Simon 2.0 out) and Moonrock.</p>
