    <h2>Changing the Tilt of the Earth</h2>

    <p>At sunset each Midwinter, we gather on the cold, windy shores of Puget Sound to catch the fading light of the sun. Once we have the dwindling light safely contained in our hurricane lanterns, we carry it across Seattle all night, stopping for food, warmth, and good company along the way. The next morning, we release it along with our prayers to the shores of Lake Washington, encouraging the light of the sun to return to us.</p>
    
    <p>This is an all-night urban hike, carrying light together through the longest night of the year.</p>

    <p><strong>Who does this?</strong></p>
    
    <p>This event is led every year by Danne Stayskal, Brice Reinhardt, and Julia Trimarco. If you know one of them, you're probably welcome to attendâ€”just email to confirm beforehand. If you received a link to this page in an email directly from one of them inviting you to this event, that means we would love for you to attend. The group each year numbers around 20 to 35 people at different parts of the hike.</p>

    <p>This event is you, us, and our intentional family. It's one of the ways we stay close through the dark and cold Seattle winters. Once you're invited, you're free to invite as well. <em>Please invite only the people to whom you'd give a key to your own home</em>. That's the bar we hold each other to for this event. This is a sacred tradition for many of us. Please don't advertise or otherwise broadcast this event on social media. Our hosts don't have the capacity for a mailing list full of people you barely know. But we do have room for our closest tribe.</p>
    
    <p><strong>When and where is this?</strong></p>
      
    <p>We begin at 4:20 PM on Friday, December 21st, 2018 in Golden Gardens Park. Get there by 3:30pm or earlier so we can catch the light together and leave on time. <em>If you're running late and don't catch us at Golden Gardens, go and park at Ballard Locks and meet us there. We'll be there around 5:15pm.</em></p>
    
    <p>We end at 7:55 AM on Saturday, December 22nd, 2018 in Seward Park. You'll need to arrange a ride back to your home from here. You're also welcome to come decompress at Brice and Kyle's home after the hike. More info on that is available below when we describe the route we take.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Can I bring kids and pets?</strong></p>

    <p>You are welcome to bring children, so long as you can keep them warm and tended-to. This is a family-friendly event.</p>
    
    <p>Our hosts aren't able to accommodate pets, so you'll need to make other arrangements for your four-legged family members.</p>
